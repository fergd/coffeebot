<span class="first-words">Prelude.</span> For those of you who have read my previous reviews, you may have noticed that when ever I am describing the coffee, I almost always remark on the crema. I do this because the crema is the soul of the espresso. Without it you are simply confronted with a dark and formless beverage that leaves you hovering over the face of some sort of liquid void. Crema contains the flavorful, complex, and oily soul of the espresso shot. It's the lifeblood and excitement of coffee itself. 

That said, when Bot1 discovered an entire coffee shop named after this beauty, it was a no-brainer, or in Bot1's case, a no-CPUer that we check it out. Everything this shop does, it does well. The website, branding, interior design and ultimately, the coffee are nothing short of stellar. Bot1 is programmed to respond to excellence by demanding we go back again, and again, and again since it triggers an infinite system loop. Right off the bat, I'd recommend you do the same. 

<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As we entered Crema (nestled in the Five Points area, or NoDo) I was struck by the overall simplicity and itty-bitty-ness of the place. The counter is no more than four paces from the front door and the menu is purposefully sparse—not only in its lack of fluff beverages but also in the fact that it is printed on the wall. It was immediately apparent the owner is a purist. For instance, this is not the shop for suburban frappu-whatever drinkers. Crema offers only three flavors: mocha, vanilla and caramel. It's the equivalent to restoring peace to the world by neutralizing one coffee-assassinating flavor at a time. However, other than the occasional mocha, I don't flavor my coffee, therefore my Americano was ordered. The lever was pulled, the shots were extracted, and the drink slid across the counter to me. The liquid rocked easily back and forth in the ceramic with the thick crema surface holding together tightly reflecting deep, red-brown and golden swirls. It glistened with the oily coffee bean residue (crema is the only time 'oil' and 'residue' are good things as descriptors), hinting at the flavor that was to come. Butter, caramel, crisp acidity and subtle bitterness filled my taste buds and for the first time in a very long time, I savored every single ounce of that Americano. (It's at this point I should mention the espresso was a Novo roast. Sound familiar? Other roasters who make an appearance at Crema are Herkimer and Pablo's- according to the website, that is.)

<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> is what it is. Clearly underground, it is cold, utilitarian and industrial with a few reclaimed odds and ends. The tables and chairs have that certain retro flair, and I'm pretty sure they are original stuff, not overpriced re-makes. Hip below-ground art adorned the brick/plaster walls when I first visited, and the room was quite bright thanks to a fairly large red-pained window in the front. I had a bit of trouble finding an outlet for my laptop and finally found one behind a couch, but I noticed plenty of people on their Macs not bothered by this who apparently have risen above the need for a plug. Who needs an outlet, though? This is the sort of place you go to sip your velvety microfoam and discuss bands that don't exist yet, not necessarily type up your doctoral thesis. There is a tiny bar that you can belly up to and watch the Baristas fashion their creations, and overall, considering the square footage, there is a good amount of seating for the size.

Finally, a few points to note: First, you don't go there if you are in a rush. It's obvious the owner is more interested in the beverage quality than in the fact you forgot to set your alarm, spent too much time watching Kardashians reruns and are now running late for work. Every drink is made one-at-a time which maximizes quality but not speediness. In fact, if you are ordering a latte or cappuccino, each will include some sort of latte design, even if you are slapping a lid on it. Second, Crema's muffins are insanely good and as a bonus they don't have the paper wrapper around the bottom so you don't have to peel it off. Let me tell you, this is reason enough to go there! Finally, they have a great selection of fine teas, but that review is up to TeaBot, not me, and TeaBot doesn't even exist...yet.

<span class="first-words">The End</span> In conclusion: go there. No excuses, just go. You won't regret it.
