The first one is obvious, stop using your charge cards. This may seem just like a silly thing to indicate, but the best way to get a grip on your spending is to only spend the cash you have - after you have paid your bills. Minute, consider consolidating your consumer debt onto one card -- or moving a balance collected from one of card, to one which includes a lower interest rate. Some people are in a very constant cycle of moving to another 0% interest rate credit card. This can be your pain, but you''ll save a small fortune and buy yourself more time in order to the debt. Third, start making double payments. In case the calculated minimum payment is just on the accrued interest, then you need to create a double payment to hit the principle with the debt. By finally hitting the principle and discontinuing us going for the card for acquisitions, you''ll see that balance commence to drop.', 0, '0', 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322) NS8/0.9.6', '', 0, 0),

And they require it to be a real address on that domain, or mail will NOT SEND! (They do this to help prevent spam.) If your contact form does not send any E-mail, then set this to a real E-mail address on the SAME domain as your web site as a possible fix. After setting the from address; if your form still does not send any E-mail, also find this setting: "Send E-mail function:", try setting it to "geekMail", then test from the contact form again. If it still does not work, try setting it to try setting it to "PHP". In most cases, this will resolve the problem. Remember to also change the settings on all your other forms.</p></li>\n<li><p>Maybe another plugin is conflicting. Do this as a test:\nTemporarily disable all your other plugins. Does it work now?

We&#8217;ve shipped 9 point releases since then, but it&#8217;s been over 17 months since a major release of BuddyPress has come through the tubes.</p>\n<p>We do our best to mirror the WordPress development cycles as closely as possible &#8211; maybe a little too closely. Back in 2004, WordPress went through a growth spurt of its own, going 9 months between major releases (also between versions 1.2 and 1.5) so we are doing the same, and skipping ahead to 1.5 ourselves.</p>\n<p>Here are the stats we&#8217;re using to justify the version inflation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>792 tickets closed</li>\n<li>494 confirmed bug fixes</li>\n<li>2,161 total code changes since 1.2 was released</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The similarities between BuddyPress and WordPress development symbolize the nature of developing something totally new and exciting, so we think it&#8217;s fitting to bump our version number in a similar fashion.</p>\n<p>Because of the volume of changes internally, we&#8217;re packaging up a developer beta so plugin authors have time to review our changes, report bugs, and give everyone a few weeks to tie up any loose ends that are left.</p>\n<p>If you are a BuddyPress plugin author, now is your time to help us help you, and check out all the work that&#8217;s gone into making the next version of BuddyPress faster, more efficient, more secure, and easier to code against.</p>\n<p>If you are a user or a designer, check out the changes to the BP Default theme. We&#8217;ve done our best to turn it into a theme you want to use, and have it still show off all the features too.</p>\n<p>If you are neither (or both) of those things, you can help by documenting the codex. We&#8217;re trying to do our part by writing the phpDoc as we go, and if you can help move some of that into the codex, it helps everyone!</p>\n<p>As always, please DO NOT run BuddyPress Beta software on your live production site. There are going to be quirks with existing plugins, and we will be updating code rapidly as bug reports come in. Install BuddyPress 1.5 on a local installation or a test site, and let us know if you find anything that isn&#8217;t working the way it should. We are hoping the beta period will only last a few weeks, with a release in August.</p>\n<p>You can <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/4894/tags/1.5-beta-1?old_path=%2F&format=zip">download BuddyPress 1.5 Beta 1</a> today, from the bottom of our <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/1.5-beta-1">Trac page</a>.

With wifi that worked the whole time and plenty of power outlets under the seats, it worked out really well.  For 2011 we&#8217;ll be returning to the UoU, in the Skaggs Biology Building.

Open source software is just like any other software, except the creator publishes the underlying source code that powers the application, allowing others to improve upon or adapt the project to their own needs, and hopefully, contribute those improvements back to the community to do the same. Think of it as the software equivalent of the “give a penny, take a penny” jar at your local convenience store.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The FCC contributed back to the WordPress community in the form of a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/faceted-search-widget/">faceted search widget</a> available in the WordPress.org plugin repository and we hope they&#8217;ll continue to contribute more code back in the future.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth a read and sending to anyone you know using WordPress who could <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress">contribute something back to the community via code, support, documentation or more</a>.</p>\n<p><em></em><strong><em><a href="http://get.wp.com/"><strong>Want WordPress for your site?

These clients are running some pretty big web properties on WordPress, and they need to stage their content, review it internally, revise it, etc. before they put it live. It&#8217;s a pretty universal need &#8211; we just did it on our own site as we were preparing the <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/ramp/">web page</a> and <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/ramp/docs/">documentation</a> for RAMP on our own site. This has always been difficult with WordPress, and had often resulted in SQL export/import followed by update scripts and/or manual copy-paste steps. RAMP solves this problem elegantly. You simply:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the RAMP plugin on your staging and production servers, and enter the auth key and URL from production in the settings for your staging server.</li>\n<li>Select the changes you&#8217;d like to send and save them as a batch.</li>\n<li>RAMP the batch up to your production server.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>RAMP doesn&#8217;t just support posts and pages either; it fully supports custom post types, categories, tags, custom taxonomies, users, menus, links and more.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We&#8217;re really proud of the underlying architecture of RAMP. We spent a long time working out just the right way to implement this type of functionality for WordPress, and I&#8217;m really pleased with the solution. We utilize core WordPress functionality and APIs, the XMLRPC layer for transport between servers, and built everything on top of an wonderfully extensible system (which uses the core WordPress hook and filter system) to allow any WordPress content to participate in a RAMP batch. We&#8217;ve already done this to <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/carrington-build/">Carrington Build</a>.</p>\n<p>RAMP is a commercial product priced at <a href="https://crowdfavorite.com/store/">$99 per staging/production server pair</a>. This includes <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/ramp/documentation/">documentation</a> and support in our <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/forums/forum/ramp">customer forum</a>.</p>\n<img src="http://alexking.org/wp/?ak_action=api_record_view&id=5973&type=feed" alt="" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 21:42:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Alex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"Matt: Pro-Patent Arguments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=38358";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"http://ma.tt/2011/07/pro-patent-arguments/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:176:"<p><a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2011/07/the-trouble-with-nathan-myrvold.html">The Trouble with Nathan Myhrvold’s Pro-Patent Arguments</a> by Paul Kedrosky.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 18:10:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"Donncha: Cookies for Comments 0.5.4";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"http://ocaoimh.ie/?p=89496380";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"http://ocaoimh.ie/2011/07/20/cookies-for-comments-0-5-4/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1577:"<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cookies-for-comments/">Cookies for Comments</a> is a WordPress plugin that can be used alongside Akismet to significantly reduce or even kill completely comment spam.</p>\n<p>Version 0.5.4 adds a rejections page in case human visitors trip over the cookie check.

It starts off with a few <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> numbers:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nOn WordPress.com we have over 218 million tables and perform tens of thousands queries per second. To scale all of this, we shard our 24 million blogs across more than 550 MySQL servers. This allows us to cope with load bursts and to handle database servers failures.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post goes on to describe some of the reasons why you might run into replication lag in MySQL and methods <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/HyperDB">HyperDB</a> uses to deal with that.  In the case of WordPress.com there are additional issues to consider, like replication across multiple datacenters.</p>\n<p>Something that HyperDB has had for awhile is the ability to force read queries back to the master if a write happened earlier on the same connection:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nIf a connection modifies data in a given table, then all subsequent SELECTs on the same connection for that table are sent to the master. Chances are replication won’t be fast enough to propagate the changes to the slaves on the same page load.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a fairly simple technique than can be remarkably useful.</p>\n<p>You can find out more about HyperDB on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/HyperDB">HyperDB WordPress Codex page</a>, the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hyperdb/">HyperDB WordPress plugin page</a>, and the <a href="http://comox.textdrive.com/mailman/listinfo/hyperdb">HyperDB mailing list</a>.

Please let me know if you have any questions on what will be covered, or if you have any suggestions:</p>\n<h3>Scaling, Servers, and Deploys — Oh My!</h3>\n<p>Alternate title: First Thing, Second Thing, and Oxford Commas — Em Dash! <img src="http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>\n<p>If you manage professional WordPress-powered sites, this is going to be an invaluable presentation for you. If you&#8217;re a cowboy coder, this presentation is a mandatory WordPress-ordered intervention. (And if you don&#8217;t know what cowboy coding is, you probably do it, and don&#8217;t even know you need help.)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve worked with a lot of WordPress installations for professional sites in my client work. They inevitably fall short in some way. What is usually the case is that the people in charge of running the installation feel that instead of them having control of the environment, they are merely present in the environment. Deployments that were meant to be scalable are often somewhat less so, in practice. Tell me if this conversation sounds familiar:</p>\n<p>&#8220;What happens if we outgrow one server?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;We&#8217;ll just add another one!&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s easy to say as a hypothetical. But what if you actually had to do it? What if a couple hundred thousand unexpected page views started coming your way and your boss/client tells you &#8220;Go ahead and add that second server we&#8217;ve been talking about&#8230; how many minutes is that going to take?&#8221; Did you think &#8220;no sweat,&#8221; or did your heart start racing just imagining the scenario?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to disclose the secret sauce. I&#8217;ll let you in on everything I&#8217;ve learned in the last seven years about how to code and architect WordPress-powered sites, how to scale up a single server, how to manage multiple servers, and how to deploy code in a way that is both responsive and prudent.</p>\n<p>Topics will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache</li>\n<li>nginx</li>\n<li>Memcached</li>\n<li>MySQL</li>\n<li>APC</li>\n<li>NFS</li>\n<li>rsync</li>\n<li>Git</li>\n<li>Puppet</li>\n<li>Capistrano</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And more. At the end you&#8217;ll feel confident that you can run professional, fast, scalable WordPress installations that will make your job easier and your clients or boss happy.</p>\n<h3>Security Showdown</h3>\n<p>Instead of my battle-worn and (even to me) rather droll talk on WordPress security, I&#8217;m going to be doing an interactive panel with Brad Williams and Jon Cave. We&#8217;ll do live security reviews of some plugins that have been submitted ahead of time. This way, you can see WordPress security practices in action! There will be prizes and everything. Should be a bunch of fun.</p>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/662/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/662/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/662/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/662/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/markjaquith.wordpress.com/662/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/markjaquith.wordpress.com/662/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/markjaquith.wordpress.com/662/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/markjaquith.wordpress.com/662/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/662/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/662/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/662/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/662/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/662/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/662/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markjaquith.wordpress.com&blog=316&post=662&subd=markjaquith&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 03:24:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"Dev Blog: Best WordCamp Speakers?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"http://wordpress.org/news/2011/07/best-wordcamp-speakers/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1599:"<p>As we complete speaker selection for <a href="http://2011.sf.wordcamp.org/">the annual WordPress conference (a.k.a.

This book was authored by Brian Bondari and Everett Griffiths, who run the <a href="http://tipsfor.us/">TipsFor.us</a> site together. I also noted that one of the technical editors was Paul Thewlis, who wrote <a title="Book Review: WordPress for Business Bloggers" href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2008/11/12/book-review-wordpress-for-business-bloggers/">WordPress for Business Bloggers</a>, which I reviewed here previously.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m always eager to check out new programming books that come my way, and that&#8217;s especially true for books that cover WordPress plugins. There are certain styles for programming books that you come to recognize &#8212; a sort of Pattern. And there are particular patterns that annoy me a little. But this book does not use those patterns, so it was refreshing to see a teaching approach that I actually like. I have to say that overall I&#8217;m pleased with this one, though there were a couple of negatives that jumped out at me a little. But first, let&#8217;s cover the good points.</p>\n<p><span id="more-55041"></span>The first chapter of WordPress 3 Plugin Development Essentials is pretty typical stuff for a development book. It covers some basic information about how to get a web development stack for your computer (MAMP, <acronym title="Microsoft, Apache, MySQL, Php"><span class="caps">WAMP</span></acronym>, XAMPP, Microsoft Web Platform, etc.), text editors and IDEs, etc. You&#8217;ll also find brief descriptions of WordPress, what plugins are, some information about source control and debugging, and a few other tidbits.</p>\n<p>Chapter 2 is where the meat begins. <a href="http://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a> will appreciate that this book begins with a dissection of the infamous <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hello-dolly/">Hello Dolly plugin</a>. The authors use the existing plugin code to illustrate the core concepts of a plugin: the information header, user-defined functions, and WordPress <acronym title="Application Interface"><span class="caps">API</span></acronym> hooks. But what I <em>really</em> liked about this first chapter is that the first exercise for the reader is to break the plugin. In fact, they have you break the plugin in several different ways, each illustrating different ways that you might encounter problems when developing your own plugin code.</p>\n<p>First, they have you remove the plugin header, and observe how WordPress will notify about automatically deactivating the plugin. Then they have you insert gibberish into the plugin to show what happens when a fatal syntax error occurs. Then they have you send output to the browser without going through WordPress hooks, showing the <acronym title="Php Hypertext Processor"><span class="caps">PHP</span></acronym> warning about sending output before HTTP headers are sent. And they also show the result of having whitespace occur after the final <acronym title="Php Hypertext Processor"><span class="caps">PHP</span></acronym> closing <code>?&gt;</code> tag, and how it is safe to omit it to avoid the error. And, of course, they also go through modifying Hello Dolly by changing which hooks it calls, so that it sends output to post content on the front page, instead of in the admin pages.</p>\n<p>I thought that this was an excellent way to start the process. Too often, programming books give you the canonical &#8220;<a href="http://www.roesler-ac.de/wolfram/hello.htm">Hello, World</a>&#8221; example, which doesn&#8217;t do much for you in the way of learning something new. In this case, they take an existing variation of Hello, World, and show you how changing various pieces of it affect WordPress or how the plugin itself operates. Exposing the reader to errors deliberately, and explaining why they happened, will help the user understand and recover from errors later on, when they happen accidentally. Kudos for that!</p>\n<p>The next chapter goes more in-depth, creating a &#8220;Digg This&#8221; plugin from scratch. This task is simple enough to understand pretty easily, while covering key concepts which help the reader become more familiar with several important WordPress functions and hooks. This process covers fetching a post&#8217;s title, content, categories and <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator"><span class="caps">URL</span></acronym>, as well as inserting Javascript into the page head. They start by creating an empty skeleton with stub functions for each method the plugin needs, and fill in the functions one-by-one, explaining its purpose.</p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t detail every chapter, but here&#8217;s a quick synopsis:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Preparing for WordPress Development</strong>, an introduction to WordPress and setting up a development environment</li>\n<li><strong>Anatomy of a Plugin</strong>, using Hello Dolly as an example</li>\n<li><strong>Social Bookmarking</strong>, building a Digg This button plugin</li>\n<li><strong>Ajax Search</strong> plugin, implementing &#8220;live search&#8221; using jQuery, and introducing using <acronym title="Php Hypertext Processor"><span class="caps">PHP</span></acronym> classes to encapsulate plugin functions</li>\n<li><strong>Content Rotator</strong> plugin, covers extending the WP_Widget class and adding a custom plugin settings page</li>\n<li><strong>Standardized Custom Content</strong>, working with Custom Fields (post meta), custom meta boxes, creating and modifying a child theme</li>\n<li><strong>Custom Post Types</strong>, working with Custom Post Types, using the Shortcode <acronym title="Application Interface"><span class="caps">API</span></acronym>, adding a settings shortcut link to the plugins page, plugin uninstall handling</li>\n<li><strong>Versioning Your Code with Subversion (SVN)</strong>, introduction to using svn to manage your code revisions</li>\n<li><strong>Preparing Your Plugin for Distribution</strong>, cleaning up your code, testing</li>\n<li><strong>Publishing Your Plugin</strong>, internationalization and localization, readme.txt file format, submitting your plugin to the wordpress.org repository</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are also two appendices. The first is a list of helpful online resources such as the <acronym title="Php Hypertext Processor"><span class="caps">PHP</span></acronym> documentation site, the WordPress Codex, and a handful of other WordPress and web development sites. Appendix B is a list of WordPress <acronym title="Application Interface"><span class="caps">API</span></acronym> functions used in the book, with a brief description of their usage.</p>\n<p>While overall I felt like this book takes a good approach and paces things well, I do have a couple of nits to pick, particularly with chapters 4 and 5. When publishing a book like this, I feel it is very important to educate the reader using best practices. Sometimes you might need to illustrate &#8220;dirty&#8221; ways of doing things to make a point, or to ease readers into a complex subject, but you should always point out best practices. For the most part, this book did a pretty good job of that, and I was pleased to see some discussion of important topics like escaping data to avoid cross-site scripting problems and other similar security risks, for example. But in the discussions of Ajax and creating plugin option pages, they fell down a bit.</p>\n<p>First, while I felt like a live search plugin was a useful example to use for discussing Ajax, I was disappointed to see that the authors did not use the built-in <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins">WordPress <acronym title="Asynchronous Javascript and XML"><span class="caps">AJAX</span></acronym> APIs</a> for this. The <code>wp_ajax_*</code> and <code>wp_ajax_nopriv_*</code> functions really make this fairly easy, once you wrap your head around it.</p>\n<p>And second, the examples of creating option pages did not take advantage of the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_API">Settings <acronym title="Application Interface"><span class="caps">API</span></acronym></a>. Using this <acronym title="Application Interface"><span class="caps">API</span></acronym> has several advantages over building your own form manually: It automatically handles security nonces for you, it automatically handles saving options to the database as a serialized array, it lets you create a validation callback function to error-check the data, it gives your options page user interface consistency with the standard WordPress admin, and it future-proofs your options page against changes to the standard <acronym title="User Interface"><span class="caps">UI</span></acronym>. I&#8217;d also recommend checking out <a href="http://ottopress.com/2009/wordpress-settings-api-tutorial/">Otto&#8217;s Settings <acronym title="Application Interface"><span class="caps">API</span></acronym> Tutorial</a> for some clear examples.</p>\n<p>Other than those two exceptions, I felt like this book provided useful examples which gently introduce the reader to important WordPress plugin <acronym title="Application Interface"><span class="caps">API</span></acronym> concepts. As the book progresses, it builds upon concepts learned previously, while providing a variety of individual example plugin projects. This is another point that I really liked &#8212; variety. I don&#8217;t like books that take the approach of building a single, large application (&#8220;<em>let&#8217;s build a shopping cart!</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>let&#8217;s build a product catalog site!</em>&#8220;). By building several stand-alone plugins to illustrate each chapter&#8217;s concepts, the reader is more likely to find something that piques their interest, and it becomes more digestible.</p>\n<p>You can get more details and download a sample chapter (Chapter 5: Content Rotator) <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/wordpress-3-plugin-development-essentials/book">from the Packt Publishing site</a>.

I&#8217;m excited to announce that WordPress 3.2 is now available to the world, both as an update in your dashboard and a <a href="http://wordpress.org/">download on WordPress.org</a>. Version 3.2 is our fifteenth major release of WordPress and comes just four months after 3.1 (which coincidentally just passed the 15 million download mark this morning), reflecting the growing speed of development in the WordPress community and our dedication to getting improvements in your hands as soon as possible. We&#8217;re dedicating this release to noted composer and pianist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gershwin">George Gershwin</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Before we get to the release, in anticipation of the State of the Word speech at the upcoming <a href="http://2011.sf.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp San Francisco</a> (the annual WordPress conference) we&#8217;re doing a survey or census of the WordPress world. If you have a moment, <a href="http://wpsurvey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2011">please fill out this survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share what <em>we learn by </em>publishing the aggregate results in August.</em></p>\n<p>The focus for this release was <strong>making WordPress faster and lighter</strong>. The first thing you&#8217;ll notice when you log in to 3.2 is a <strong>refreshed dashboard design</strong> that tightens the typography, design, and code behind the admin. (Rhapsody in Grey?) If you&#8217;re starting a new blog, you&#8217;ll also appreciate the fully HTML5 <strong>new Twenty Eleven theme</strong>, fulfilling our plan to replace the default theme every year. Start writing your first post in our redesigned post editor and venture to the full-screen button in the editing toolbar to enter the new <strong>distraction-free writing or zen mode</strong>, my personal favorite feature of the release. All of the widgets, menus, buttons, and interface elements fade away to allow you to compose and edit your thoughts in a completely clean environment conducive to writing, but when your mouse strays to the top of the screen your most-used shortcuts are right there where you need them. (I like to press F11 to take my browser full-screen, getting rid of even the OS chrome.)</p>\n<p><embed src="http://v.wordpress.com/ac07H291" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="600" height="337" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" wmode="transparent"></embed></p>\n<p>Under the hood there have been a number of improvements, not the least of which is the <strong>streamlining</strong> enabled by our <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/">previously announced plan</a> of retiring support for PHP4, older versions of MySQL, and legacy browsers like IE6, which allows us to take advantage of more features enabled by new technologies. The <strong>admin bar</strong> has a few more shortcuts to your most commonly-used actions. On the comment moderation screen, the new <strong>approve &amp; reply</strong> feature speeds up your conversation management. You&#8217;ll notice in your first update after 3.2 that we&#8217;ll only be updating the files that have changed with each new release instead of every file in your WordPress installation, which makes <strong>updates significantly faster on all hosting platforms</strong>. There are also some fun new theme features shown off by Twenty Eleven, like the ability to have multiple <strong>rotating header images</strong> to highlight all of your favorite photos.</p>\n<p>There is way more, like our new freedoms and credits screens (linked from your dashboard footer), so for the full story check out the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.2">Codex page on 3.2</a> or the <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.2">Trac milestone which includes the 400+ tickets closed in this release</a>.</p>\n<h3>A Community Effort</h3>\n<p>We now finally have a credits page inside of WordPress itself (though a cool revision is coming in 3.3), but for posterity let&#8217;s give a round of applause to these fine folks who contributed to 3.2:</p>\n<p><a

With more than 45 million people using WordPress, though, even a small percentage can mean a lot of people! Don&#8217;t caught with your <del>pants</del> dashboard down &#8212; make sure you&#8217;re running compatible versions of PHP and MySQL before you update <del>tomorrow</del> when WordPress 3.2 is released.</p>\n<p>Log in to your hosting account, and check to make sure you have at least  PHP 5.2.4 and MySQL 5.0. Most of the major hosts already default to these or newer versions, but there are some exceptions. Check to see which versions you are running, and if you&#8217;re still on an older version, it should be as simple as changing a dropdown menu and clicking Save to get up to date.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know how to find this information in your hosting account or you don&#8217;t even know how to access your hosting control panel because someone else manages that for you, don&#8217;t fret. You can <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/health-check/">find out if you&#8217;re ready for 3.2 with the Health Check plugin</a>. In your dashboard, go to Plugins → Add New and search for &#8220;health check&#8221; (it should be the first result). Install it, activate it, and it will tell you if you need to update anything.</p>\n<p>If you need more help, contact your host&#8217;s customer service and use this email template to ask them to help you.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hi there. I host my domain [example.com] with you, and I run WordPress on my site. The minimum requirements are changing to PHP 5.2.4 and MySQL 5.0, and I would appreciate your help in confirming that my site&#8217;s setup meets these requirements. If I&#8217;m currently running an older version of PHP or MySQL, could you update it for me, or tell me how to do it? Thanks so much!</p></blockquote>\n<p>If your host replies that they can&#8217;t update to these versions, it might be time to <a href="http://wordpress.org/hosting/">look for a new host</a>.</p>\n<h3>IE6 and Outdated Browsers</h3>\n<p>With 3.2, we&#8217;re also dropping support for Internet Explorer 6, a 10-years-old outdated browser that even <a href="http://www.ie6countdown.com/">Microsoft is ready to leave behind</a>. From now on, if you access your WordPress dashboard from an outdated browser, we&#8217;ll let you know. Why? Because as web technology improves, so does WordPress, as we build features to take advantage of these improvements. If you&#8217;re using an out-of-date browser, chances are you&#8217;re missing out.</p>\n<p>If your browser is out of date, you&#8217;ll see a friendly orangey-yellow box in your dashboard letting you know you a newer version is available (which you can dismiss, of course). If you&#8217;re using IE6, though, the box will be red, and your dashboard will not function properly. If you&#8217;re stuck on IE6 because the computer you use is maintained by a business, library, school, or the like, and you are not able to download a newer browser, here&#8217;s a sample email you can use to ask your boss/administrator/IT guys to update the browser.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hi there. The computer I use at [where you use the computer] is equipped with an out-of-date web browser. Internet Explorer 6 was created 10 years ago, before modern web standards, and does not support modern web applications. More and more sites and applications are dropping support for IE6, including the new version of WordPress. Even Microsoft, the makers of IE6, are counting down until IE6 goes the way of the dinosaur (see http://www.ie6countdown.com/ for more information). Can you please install an updated version of IE or any modern browser (see http://browsehappy.com for more information) on the available computers? Thank you very much.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Welcome to the future!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"http://wordpress.org/news/2011/07/are-you-ready-for-wordpress-3-2/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:44:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n			\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"WordPress 3.1.4 (and 3.2 Release Candidate 3)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"http://wordpress.org/news/2011/06/wordpress-3-1-4/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://wordpress.org/news/2011/06/wordpress-3-1-4/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 29 Jun 2011 19:00:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Security";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=1927";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:368:"WordPress 3.1.4 is available now and is a maintenance and security update for all previous versions.

Consult the <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.1/?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=18377&amp;stop_rev=18043">change log</a> for more details.</p>\n<p><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/download/"><strong>Download WordPress 3.1.4</strong></a> or update immediately from the Dashboard → Updates menu in your site&#8217;s admin area.</strong></p>\n<h3>WordPress 3.2 Release Candidate 3</h3>\n<p>This release was about all that stood in the way of a final release of WordPress 3.2. So we&#8217;re also announcing the third release candidate for 3.2, which contains all of the fixes in 3.1.4; few minor RTL, JavaScript, and user interface fixes; and ensures graceful failures if 3.2 is run on PHP4. As a reminder, we&#8217;ve bumped our minimum requirements for version 3.2 to PHP 5.2.4 and MySQL 5.0.</p>\n<p>To test WordPress 3.2, try the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester plugin</a> (you&#8217;ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.2-RC3.zip">download the release candidate here</a> (zip). At this stage, plugin authors should be doing final tests to ensure compatibility.</p>\n<p><em>Bonus: For more on what to test and what to do if you find an issue, please read <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2011/05/wordpress-3-2-beta-1/">our Beta 1 post</a>.</em></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/news/2011/06/wordpress-3-1-4/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:41:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n			\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"WordPress 3.2 Release Candidate 2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://wordpress.org/news/2011/06/wordpress-3-2-release-candidate-2/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://wordpress.org/news/2011/06/wordpress-3-2-release-candidate-2/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 23:15:22 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Testing";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=1915";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:358:"Howdy!

In addition to Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s annual &#8220;State of the Word&#8221; address, WCSF has played host to talks by people like Mark Jaquith, Matt Cutts, Richard Stallman, Scott Berkun, Karl Fogel, Tim Ferriss, Tara Hunt, Chris Pirillo, and John Lilly. With 3 days of content this year instead of just one, the list of speakers should be even more impressive.

We released <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2011/05/wordpress-3-2-beta-1/">Beta 1</a> thirteen days ago, and today we&#8217;re putting out Beta 2 for your testing pleasure.</p>\n<p>This is still beta software, so <strong>we don&#8217;t recommend that you use it on production sites</strong>. But if you&#8217;re a plugin developer, a theme developer, or a site administrator, <strong>you should be running this on your test environments</strong> and <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Reporting_Bugs">reporting any bugs</a> you find. If you&#8217;re a WordPress user who wants to open your presents early, take advantage of WordPress&#8217; famous 5-minute install and spin up a secondary test site. Let us know what you think!</p>\n<p>The plan is to start putting out release candidates in early June, and to release WordPress 3.2 by the end of the month. The more you help us iron out issues during the beta period, the more likely we are to hit those dates. To misappropriate and mangle a quote from Mahatma Gandhi: &#8220;Be the punctuality you want to see in the WordPress.&#8221; In other words, test now!</p>\n<p>Here are some of the things that changed since Beta 1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/">Google Chrome Frame</a> is now supported in the admin, if you have it installed. This is especially useful for IE 6 users (remember, IE 6 is otherwise deprecated for the admin).</li>\n<li>The admin is less ugly in IE 7.</li>\n<li>The blue admin color scheme has caught up to the grey one, and is ready for testing.</li>\n<li>We are now bundling jQuery 1.6.1. You should test any JS that uses jQuery. WordPress JavaScript guru Andrew Ozz has <a href="http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/jquery-updates-in-wordpress-3-2/">a post with more info</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.2-beta2.zip">Download WordPress 3.2 Beta 2</a></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/news/2011/05/wordpress-3-1-3/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:4:"href";s:31:"http://wordpress.org/news/feed/";s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:44:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/";a:2:{s:12:"updatePeriod";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"hourly";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:15:"updateFrequency";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:8:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Tue, 02 Aug 2011 13:38:20 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:23:"text/xml; charset=UTF-8";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:10:"x-pingback";s:36:"http://wordpress.org/news/xmlrpc.php";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Sat, 16 Jul 2011 21:32:34 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT luv 139";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20090627192103";}', 'no');

We found ourselves at Folsom St. Coffee Co. This is a college joint through and through, and the day we visited it was its usual self: packed, hip...and green. According to their website, Folsom St. Coffee is “Boulder''s only true eco-friendly coffeehouse. Folsom St. Coffee Co. was awarded the Eco-Cycle award for ''Zero Waste or Darn Near'' as well as the "Waste Reduction" award from the Center For Resource Conservation.” I believe it, because when Bot1 tried to throw away his trash, his waste eliminating algorithm caused his CPU to overheat just trying to sort out which tub to throw what in.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As has become customary, a double espresso was ordered and Bot1 left to talk up a couple students who were sitting outside. The espresso presented to me had a deceivingly beautiful thick crema that held fast when I spooned some sugar on top. That was a good sign. The flavor, however, was a disappointment. Oddly enough I felt like I was drinking a lime. Of course there were most of the typical espresso qualities, but the acidity was shocking! I''d like to attribute this to the extraction of the shot, but I watched it pour and everything was on the up and up. The flavor evened out when it was in an Americano, but overall I wasn''t too impressed with the flavor.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span>Like many coffee shops, however, the experience doesn''t always center around the coffee, and ultimately Folsom St. Coffee delivered in other areas. The atmosphere was welcoming, cozy and was the sort of place in which I felt I could get motivated to finally write my 20 page single-spaced essay on the relationship between Pyongyang and Beijing. The muddled and haphazard decor actually cemented the cozy feeling, and that constant murmur of a packed coffee house was ideal for working, meeting friends, or simply sipping a cup of coffee. Complete with poetry, open mic nights and live music acts, this place is hopping a good part of every day, and the sort of place young hipsters like to frequent.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> Overall this coffee shop is very enjoyable, and despite being turned down three whole times, Bot1 vowed it wouldn''t keep him down and will definitely return. While the coffee didn''t bowl me over, if you keep it to lattes, Americanos, teas and brews you won''t be disappointed. <span class="end-icon">END</span>\r\n\r\n[mappress mapid="6"]', 'Folsom St. Coffee Company', 'Bot1 had just completed a lecture at CU on the intricacies of wiring a common household goldfish, and like he is after every lecture, found his system needing a certain caffeine boost.

No false pretenses, no agendas, no long <span style="color:#993300;font-family:''ChunkFiveRegular'';font-size:1.6em; font-weight:normal;">loquacious</span> sentences, just some chatting about coffee and the coffee culture. Ultimately, this site should serve as a resource for people looking for new and exciting coffee shops. Plain and simple.\r\n\r\nYou may be wondering if I even know anything about coffee. Yes, yes I do. Then again, no, no I don’t. In the “yes” camp, I have over 10 years experience working in the coffee business. I built and ran a coffee shop early this millennium and upon moving to a new suburban area, I spent my time working for various shops while going to school. In the “no” camp, I know that coffee is not a stagnant entity easy to sum up. Coffee is more than just 98% water; it’s a culture, a way of life, a multidimensional beverage that changes by the seasons, countries and political uprisings. It is this complex personality that I love about coffee-always changing and morphing, yet somehow staying comfortably familiar regardless the venue in which it''s consumed.\r\n\r\nThat''s enough about me.

According to their website, Folsom St. Coffee is “Boulder''s only true eco-friendly coffeehouse. Folsom St. Coffee Co. was awarded the Eco-Cycle award for ''Zero Waste or Darn Near'' as well as the "Waste Reduction" award from the Center For Resource Conservation.” I believe it, because when Bot1 tried to throw away his trash, his waste eliminating algorithm caused his CPU to overheat just trying to sort out which tub to throw what in.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As has become customary, a double espresso was ordered and Bot1 left to talk up a couple students who were sitting outside. The espresso presented to me had a deceivingly beautiful thick crema that held fast when I spooned some sugar on top. That was a good sign. The flavor, however, was a disappointment. Oddly enough I felt like I was drinking a lime. Of course there were most of the typical espresso qualities, but the acidity was shocking! I''d like to attribute this to the extraction of the shot, but I watched it pour and everything was on the up and up. The flavor evened out when it was in an Americano, but overall I wasn''t too impressed with the flavor.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span>Like many coffee shops, however, the experience doesn''t always center around the coffee, and ultimately Folsom St. Coffee delivered in other areas. The atmosphere was welcoming, cozy and was the sort of place in which I felt I could get motivated to finally write my 20 page single-spaced essay on the relationship between Pyongyang and Beijing. The muddled and haphazard decor actually cemented the cozy feeling, and that constant murmur of a packed coffee house was ideal for working, meeting friends, or simply sipping a cup of coffee. Complete with poetry, open mic nights and live music acts, this place is hopping a good part of every day, and the sort of place young hipsters like to frequent.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> Overall this coffee shop is very enjoyable, and despite being turned down three whole times, Bot1 vowed it wouldn''t keep him down and will definitely return.

That said, it was hot, and I needed something cool.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee</span> The person working there, who I later found out was the owner, convinced me to try what he called a "toddy", or a cold brewed coffee. I say convinced, because I am a pretty staunch hot coffee kind of guy. Bot1 couldn''t compute the concept of cold coffee, and already being overheated from the 90 degree outside temps, inadvertently went into hibernate mode before his processor overheated. However, I accepted. The cold brew turned out to be exactly what I needed on that hot day. Unlike other iced coffees that I''ve had which usually capitalize on overwhelmingly acidic, citrus notes to fool you in to thinking you''re being refreshed, there was a general lack of acidity which was replaced with a surprisingly deep, smooth palette of caramel and earth tones. Not at all what I expected from a cold coffee. A hint of spice lingered on my tongue and the aftertaste, despite the overall intensity, was very pleasant. The flavor lasted, as well, and despite being slightly watered down from the ice, my last sip was just as good as the first. I was sold.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span>As for the other important aspects to the shop: service and atmosphere, there are a few more notes to ad. Since I was served by the owner, I was immediately engaged in pleasant conversation and was able to talk for a fair amount of time about coffee, asking questions, etc., and he was more than willing to chat. I get the vibe that it''s an atmosphere he tries to foster. And, speaking of atmosphere, well, you don''t go there for it. The tables were uncomfortable, especially for the lengthy amount of time I was there (waiting on Bot1 to wake up), the blue walls made me nervous, and the local art display, while well-intentioned, was haphazard and not well organized.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span><span style="color: #999999;"><em>(A note here: this original review was written back in July and I have since seen they are doing some work on the place, so the atmosphere complaint might be a moot point)</em></span> None of that would keep me from there, however, because this is the kind of coffee shop you go to for the superb coffee, you don''t have to go there for anything else.

That said, it was hot, and I needed something cool.<!--more-->\n\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee</span> The person working there, who I later found out was the owner, convinced me to try what he called a "toddy", or a cold brewed coffee. I say convinced, because I am a pretty staunch hot coffee kind of guy. Bot1 couldn''t compute the concept of cold coffee, and already being overheated from the 90 degree outside temps, inadvertently went into hibernate mode before his processor overheated. However, I accepted. The cold brew turned out to be exactly what I needed on that hot day. Unlike other iced coffees that I''ve had which usually capitalize on overwhelmingly acidic, citrus notes to fool you in to thinking you''re being refreshed, there was a general lack of acidity which was replaced with a surprisingly deep, smooth palette of caramel and earth tones. Not at all what I expected from a cold coffee. A hint of spice lingered on my tongue and the aftertaste, despite the overall intensity, was very pleasant. The flavor lasted, as well, and despite being slightly watered down from the ice, my last sip was just as good as the first. I was sold.\n\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span>As for the other important aspects to the shop: service and atmosphere, there are a few more notes to ad. Since I was served by the owner, I was immediately engaged in pleasant conversation and was able to talk for a fair amount of time about coffee, asking questions, etc., and he was more than willing to chat. I get the vibe that it''s an atmosphere he tries to foster. And, speaking of atmosphere, well, you don''t go there for it. The tables were uncomfortable, especially for the lengthy amount of time I was there (waiting on Bot1 to wake up), the blue walls made me nervous, and the local art display, while well-intentioned, was haphazard and not well organized.\n\n<span class="first-words">The End</span><span style="color: #999999;"><em>(A note here: this original review was written back in July and I have since seen they are doing some work on the place, so the atmosphere complaint might be a moot point)</em></span> None of that would keep me from there, however, because this is the kind of coffee shop you go to for the superb coffee, you don''t have to go there for anything else.

I know, I know, a suburban coffee shop, but bear with me...<!--more-->\n\n<h4><span class="first-words">The History</span></h4> From what I know about this place, its pedigree is traced back to Tacoma, Washington—not a bad place to come from, I suppose. Their self-description talks of being a vital part of the community and being inspired by Italy''s espresso culture, yada yada yada. Nearly everyone says that. Even Howard Schultz said that at one time and look where that got us. However, their expressed desire to be a neighborhood coffee shop seems to actually be working.\n\n<h4><span class="first-words">The Coffee</span></h4> My standard first-time drink is usually an Americano or latte. In this case, the Americano is a wonderful baseline drink. If made correctly, you get a lovely crema, the hot water and espresso combination even out the flavor of the coffee, and let''s face it: espresso is gone way too fast. I''m not Italian, for Pete''s sake. I love espresso shots but will only drink it straight in places I really trust. To my delight, I heard the familiar banging of portafilters into bins, and I had a feeling I was in for a treat. The drink was produced and brought to my table, whereupon I viewed that  nice layer of crema. The flavor was good. Not amazing, but good. The espresso certainly embodied everything a fine espresso should: full body, slight bitterness, subtle caramel tones; but for me, the dimension didn''t go far enough. That''s hardly a negative, since the intensity of espresso is, after all, subjective.\n\n<h4><span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span></h4> For once, this is a suburban coffee shop that is actually comfortable and has a hint of urban dinge that in my opinion, all the best coffee shops have. Sometimes, the dingier the better. The deep yellow-gold, black, copper and dark wood mix well to form a comfortable and inspiring atmosphere. Armed with a great comfy-couch area and plenty of tables (including outside seating) you definitely have your choice of places to sit. Mine, however, was by the fireplace. And that''s enough about the design, I drink coffee, after all.\n\n<h4><span class="first-words">The End</span></h4> Finally, the experience was punctuated by genuinely nice staff. I''ve been a few times, and even Bot1 has sneaked over there a couple times when I haven''t been looking. Witty small talk and a staff that calls  you by name on the second visit is a good step in the direction of having a lasting neighborhood coffee shop.<span class="end-icon">END</span>\n[mappress]', 'Forza Coffee', 'I was trying to decide which coffee house to review first for Coffee-Bot.

In the “no” camp, I know that coffee is not a stagnant entity easy to sum up. Coffee is more than just 98% water; it’s a culture, a way of life, a multidimensional beverage that changes by the seasons, countries and political uprisings.

Even though we ordered a small, it came in a nice big mug, and after some detailed chemical analysis, Bot1 concluded the cinnamon on top of the foam was in fact, cinnamon. A nice touch, but if you don''t like people putting spices on your coffee, you might mention that upon ordering. After this, he lost interest, went over to the bar, and I was left to do the tasting by myself.\r\n\r\nThe latte was...good; nothing amazing. The foam was a tad bubbly and I would have liked more espresso presence, but the flavor that was there was smooth and balanced, so I can''t really complain. This isn''t an artisan place, so I didn''t detect much passion for coffee itself; I understand that coffee passion isn''t necessarily the point to the place.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> The main thing about this joint is that you can come in, set up your lappy, and do what you do best: hit up Facebook. Keep in mind that most people who sit there for a while are also on their laptops, so the connection speed is pretty slow. So, if you''re heading there to play Warcraft, it might not be the best place. Then again, you probably wouldn''t actually head outside to go to a coffee shop, either.\r\n\r\nAnother great aspect is the presence of living, breathing people (not just spoiled robots), and at this place, the flow of humans is pretty constant. Of all the times I have visited, I''ve never seen it empty, and I like that. The steady murmur of conversation is the perfect soundtrack to get my work done. It definitely is a neighborhood staple, and you aren''t without choices on where to sit or plug in. There''s plenty of room in the coffee side, bar side, and there''s even a little patio outback where cigarettes tend to be smoked.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> Overall, it''s a good place, and I find myself recommending it often.

Bot1 has no patience for traffic or mobs of people, and when confronted with such situations, his programmed reaction is to drive 30 mph over the speed limit in one direction--stopping for no one. That''s even more dangerous considering the amount of college students and left-over hippies riding around on bicycles in this town. Had he not erupted in such acutely emulated anger, we would never have stumbled across Jet''s Espressoria—quaintly situated slightly off the beaten path in Boulder, Colorado.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> An Americano was ordered, and it was presented to me in a mug and with a beautiful golden crema. As I sipped it, my mouth was filled with a wonderful rich, dense, and full-bodied flavor. It was exactly what I needed after riding in a Subaru with a crazed robot. The flavor held, and over the course of my stay the taste never turned extremely acidic, like some coffees tend to do as they cool. This was the work of a fine roast, great espresso skills, and a wonderful espresso machine. Based on a tweet from back in July, they serve Box Car Espresso, Novo Espresso, and Boulder Organic Espresso. For any of you who have read my other posts, you know you usually have me at “Novo”. Judging from the extremely steady stream of customers, they all agreed with the quality as well. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span> This place has a very local, neighborhood, some might say “indie” feel. I interpreted a loose 50''s vibe underscored by photographs of abandoned Route 66-style motels and gas stations, retro-looking tables and chairs and swirling ceiling fans. On the face of it, I personally am not a fan of this kind of look for a coffee shop, but I found myself quite comfortable and Bot1 felt he was among kin, being that most of his metal body work originated from the 50''s. It also had the dinge (which I''m beginning to think is a word I made up) factor I love so much: sketchy paint jobs, cluttered bar and counter, uneven tables and hand-written signs. It was also filled with the bicycle riding naturalists, designers, and college students that Bot1 nearly annihilated on the way over. In short, a great mix of people.\r\n\r\nJet''s Espressoria also bills itself as a bakery and their presentation of fine items was not lacking. Because of their $5 minimum for credit card use, I ordered a blueberry muffin as well. When I do these reviews I''m well aware that I am merely taking a snapshot of an overall experience and I allow quite a bit for less-than-great food, drink, or atmosphere, but this blueberry muffin was, well, not great. That said, I noticed most people going for their assortment of quiches and breakfast burritos which all looked wonderful, and next time I visit I will be digging in to one of these for sure. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> Overall this place was a killer find. The coffee quality is way up there and I am very willing to overlook the muffin disappointment in light of the fine coffee and atmosphere. The employees (owners?) were very friendly and seemed genuinely focused on providing an outstanding product.

Their self-description talks of being a vital part of the community and being inspired by Italy''s espresso culture, yada yada yada. Nearly everyone says that. Even Howard Schultz said that at one time and look where that got us. However, their expressed desire to be a neighborhood coffee shop seems to actually be working.\r\n<h4><span class="first-words">The Coffee</span></h4>\r\nMy standard first-time drink is usually an Americano or latte. In this case, the Americano is a wonderful baseline drink. If made correctly, you get a lovely crema, the hot water and espresso combination even out the flavor of the coffee, and let''s face it: espresso is gone way too fast. I''m not Italian, for Pete''s sake. I love espresso shots but will only drink it straight in places I really trust. To my delight, I heard the familiar banging of portafilters into bins, and I had a feeling I was in for a treat. The drink was produced and brought to my table, whereupon I viewed that  nice layer of crema. The flavor was good. Not amazing, but good. The espresso certainly embodied everything a fine espresso should: full body, slight bitterness, subtle caramel tones; but for me, the dimension didn''t go far enough. That''s hardly a negative, since the intensity of espresso is, after all, subjective.\r\n<h4><span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span></h4>\r\nFor once, this is a suburban coffee shop that is actually comfortable and has a hint of urban dinge that in my opinion, all the best coffee shops have. Sometimes, the dingier the better. The deep yellow-gold, black, copper and dark wood mix well to form a comfortable and inspiring atmosphere. Armed with a great comfy-couch area and plenty of tables (including outside seating) you definitely have your choice of places to sit. Mine, however, was by the fireplace. And that''s enough about the design, I drink coffee, after all.\r\n<h4><span class="first-words">The End</span></h4>\r\nFinally, the experience was punctuated by genuinely nice staff. I''ve been a few times, and even Bot1 has sneaked over there a couple times when I haven''t been looking. Witty small talk and a staff that calls  you by name on the second visit is a good step in the direction of having a lasting neighborhood coffee shop.<span class="end-icon">END</span>\r\n[mappress]', 'Forza Coffee', 'I was trying to decide which coffee house to review first for Coffee-Bot.

Their self-description talks of being a vital part of the community and being inspired by Italy''s espresso culture, yada yada yada. Nearly everyone says that. Even Howard Schultz said that at one time and look where that got us. However, their expressed desire to be a neighborhood coffee shop seems to actually be working.\r\n<h4><span class="first-words">The Coffee</span></h4>\r\nMy standard first-time drink is usually an Americano or latte. In this case, the Americano is a wonderful baseline drink. If made correctly, you get a lovely crema, the hot water and espresso combination even out the flavor of the coffee, and let''s face it: espresso is gone way too fast. I''m not Italian, for Pete''s sake. I love espresso shots but will only drink it straight in places I really trust. To my delight, I heard the familiar banging of portafilters into bins, and I had a feeling I was in for a treat. The drink was produced and brought to my table, whereupon I viewed that  nice layer of crema. The flavor was good. Not amazing, but good. The espresso certainly embodied everything a fine espresso should: full body, slight bitterness, subtle caramel tones; but for me, the dimension didn''t go far enough. That''s hardly a negative, since the intensity of espresso is, after all, subjective.\r\n<h4><span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span></h4>\r\nFor once, this is a suburban coffee shop that is actually comfortable and has a hint of urban dinge that in my opinion, all the best coffee shops have. Sometimes, the dingier the better. The deep yellow-gold, black, copper and dark wood mix well to form a comfortable and inspiring atmosphere. Armed with a great comfy-couch area and plenty of tables (including outside seating) you definitely have your choice of places to sit. Mine, however, was by the fireplace. And that''s enough about the design, I drink coffee, after all.\r\n<h4><span class="first-words">The End</span></h4>\r\nFinally, the experience was punctuated by genuinely nice staff. I''ve been a few times, and even Bot1 has sneaked over there a couple times when I haven''t been looking.

Even though we ordered a small, it came in a nice big mug, and after some detailed chemical analysis, Bot1 concluded the cinnamon on top of the foam was in fact, cinnamon. A nice touch, but if you don''t like people putting spices on your coffee, you might mention that upon ordering. After this, he lost interest, went over to the bar, and I was left to do the tasting by myself.\r\n\r\nThe latte was...good; nothing amazing. The foam was a tad bubbly and I would have liked more espresso presence, but the flavor that was there was smooth and balanced, so I can''t really complain. This isn''t an artisan place, so I didn''t detect much passion for coffee itself; I understand that coffee passion isn''t necessarily the point to the place.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> The main thing about this joint is that you can come in, set up your lappy, and do what you do best: hit up Facebook. Keep in mind that most people who sit there for a while are also on their laptops, so the connection speed is pretty slow. So, if you''re heading there to play Warcraft, it might not be the best place. Then again, you probably wouldn''t actually head outside to go to a coffee shop, either.\r\n\r\nAnother great aspect is the presence of living, breathing people (not just spoiled robots), and at this place, the flow of humans is pretty constant. Of all the times I have visited, I''ve never seen it empty, and I like that. The steady murmur of conversation is the perfect soundtrack to get my work done. It definitely is a neighborhood staple, and you aren''t without choices on where to sit or plug in. There''s plenty of room in the coffee side, bar side, and there''s even a little patio outback where cigarettes tend to be smoked.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> Overall, it''s a good place, and I find myself recommending it often.

I say convinced, because I am a pretty staunch hot coffee kind of guy. Bot1 couldn''t compute the concept of cold coffee, and already being overheated from the 90 degree outside temps, inadvertently went into hibernate mode before his processor overheated. However, I accepted. The cold brew turned out to be exactly what I needed on that hot day. Unlike other iced coffees that I''ve had which usually capitalize on overwhelmingly acidic, citrus notes to fool you in to thinking you''re being refreshed, there was a general lack of acidity which was replaced with a surprisingly deep, smooth palette of caramel and earth tones. Not at all what I expected from a cold coffee. A hint of spice lingered on my tongue and the aftertaste, despite the overall intensity, was very pleasant. The flavor lasted, as well, and despite being slightly watered down from the ice, my last sip was just as good as the first. I was sold.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span>As for the other important aspects to the shop: service and atmosphere, there are a few more notes to ad. Since I was served by the owner, I was immediately engaged in pleasant conversation and was able to talk for a fair amount of time about coffee, asking questions, etc., and he was more than willing to chat. I get the vibe that it''s an atmosphere he tries to foster. And, speaking of atmosphere, well, you don''t go there for it.

If you remember back to his reading of “Death Beam” a few <a href="http://coffeebot.co/coffee-shop-reviews/common-grounds-coffee-house-3/">posts</a> ago, you know that I try to discourage anything that might be violent or illegal...or involve the word “death”.

Upon entrance, you walk straight down a hallway to the counter, and in my case, was met by a very friendly employee.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> An Americano was ordered and with it in hand, I turned the corner, entered the living room, and flopped down on one of the couches. Ultimately, I wasn''t going to expect much from the cup of coffee. The machine was automatic and they serve Illy coffee. Whenever I experience this kind of scenario, this usually translates to a very tame, albeit drinkable, cup of coffee. And I was right. There were no overwhelming flavors or distinctions to the espresso, just utilitarian goodness. I know I sound snooty when I immediately dismiss a beverage produced from an automatic machine, especially since this blog is called "Coffee Bot" which implies a certain level of automation, but understand that ultimately it is the human element in the creation of a beverage that gives it its ultimate dimension and uniqueness. It''s that human element that fuels my passion for exceptional coffee.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span> The atmosphere didn''t disappoint. Once I rounded the corner into the seating area (or living room), I was immediately impressed with how many tables and chairs could fit amid the cozy space. A large picture window at the end of the room gave a bright, framed view of 17th street, and the light that poured in lit the walls full of local art. Wood floors, quiet music and a plentiful supply of power strips made Illegal Grounds a perfect spot to hunker down and get straight to conversation, work, or relaxation. <em>Take note: this place was pretty quiet despite the small crowd. To that end, if you are going to discuss the party habits of fellow world leaders and don''t want your secrets ending up on Wikileaks, this might not be the right place for those conversations. Alternatively, you could sit outside on the covered porch-there are far less people there. </em>\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> Even though Bot1 didn''t fit easily between the tables and chairs, I would say our visit was a success and we will definitely return.

That said, it was hot, and I needed something cool.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee</span> The person working there, who I later found out was the owner, convinced me to try what he called a "toddy", or a cold brewed coffee. I say convinced, because I am a pretty staunch hot coffee kind of guy. Bot1 couldn''t compute the concept of cold coffee, and already being overheated from the 90 degree outside temps, inadvertently went into hibernate mode before his processor overheated. However, I accepted. The cold brew turned out to be exactly what I needed on that hot day. Unlike other iced coffees that I''ve had which usually capitalize on overwhelmingly acidic, citrus notes to fool you in to thinking you''re being refreshed, there was a general lack of acidity which was replaced with a surprisingly deep, smooth palette of caramel and earth tones. Not at all what I expected from a cold coffee. A hint of spice lingered on my tongue and the aftertaste, despite the overall intensity, was very pleasant. The flavor lasted, as well, and despite being slightly watered down from the ice, my last sip was just as good as the first. I was sold.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span>As for the other important aspects to the shop: service and atmosphere, there are a few more notes to ad. Since I was served by the owner, I was immediately engaged in pleasant conversation and was able to talk for a fair amount of time about coffee, asking questions, etc., and he was more than willing to chat. I get the vibe that it''s an atmosphere he tries to foster. And, speaking of atmosphere, well, you don''t go there for it. The tables were uncomfortable, especially for the lengthy amount of time I was there (waiting on Bot1 to wake up), the blue walls made me nervous, and the local art display, while well-intentioned, was haphazard and not well organized.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span><span style="color: #999999;"><em>(A note here: this original review was written back in July and I have since seen they are doing some work on the place, so the atmosphere complaint might be a moot point)</em></span> None of that would keep me from there, however, because this is the kind of coffee shop you go to for the superb coffee, you don''t have to go there for anything else.

It''s a great place being not only a coffee shop, but also a cafe and bar.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee</span> Bot1 showed up in a pair of skinny jeans he had purchased from the Salvation Army, and after I wrestled them off of him, he sulked up to the counter and ordered a small latte. Even though we ordered a small, it came in a nice big mug, and after some detailed chemical analysis, Bot1 concluded the cinnamon on top of the foam was in fact, cinnamon. A nice touch, but if you don''t like people putting spices on your coffee, you might mention that upon ordering. After this, he lost interest, went over to the bar, and I was left to do the tasting by myself.\r\n\r\nThe latte was...good; nothing amazing. The foam was a tad bubbly and I would have liked more espresso presence, but the flavor that was there was smooth and balanced, so I can''t really complain. This isn''t an artisan place, so I didn''t detect much passion for coffee itself; I understand that coffee passion isn''t necessarily the point to the place.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> The main thing about this joint is that you can come in, set up your lappy, and do what you do best: hit up Facebook. Keep in mind that most people who sit there for a while are also on their laptops, so the connection speed is pretty slow. So, if you''re heading there to play Warcraft, it might not be the best place. Then again, you probably wouldn''t actually head outside to go to a coffee shop, either.\r\n\r\nAnother great aspect is the presence of living, breathing people (not just spoiled robots), and at this place, the flow of humans is pretty constant. Of all the times I have visited, I''ve never seen it empty, and I like that. The steady murmur of conversation is the perfect soundtrack to get my work done. It definitely is a neighborhood staple, and you aren''t without choices on where to sit or plug in. There''s plenty of room in the coffee side, bar side, and there''s even a little patio outback where cigarettes tend to be smoked.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> Overall, it''s a good place, and I find myself recommending it often.

It''s a great place being not only a coffee shop, but also a cafe and bar.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee</span> Bot1 showed up in a pair of skinny jeans he had purchased from the Salvation Army, and after I wrestled them off of him, he sulked up to the counter and ordered a small latte. Even though we ordered a small, it came in a nice big mug, and after some detailed chemical analysis, Bot1 concluded the cinnamon on top of the foam was in fact, cinnamon. A nice touch, but if you don''t like people putting spices on your coffee, you might mention that upon ordering. After this, he lost interest, went over to the bar, and I was left to do the tasting by myself.\r\n\r\nThe latte was...good; nothing amazing. The foam was a tad bubbly and I would have liked more espresso presence, but the flavor that was there was smooth and balanced, so I can''t really complain. This isn''t an artisan place, so I didn''t detect much passion for coffee itself; I understand that coffee passion isn''t necessarily the point to the place.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> The main thing about this joint is that you can come in, set up your lappy, and do what you do best: hit up Facebook. Keep in mind that most people who sit there for a while are also on their laptops, so the connection speed is pretty slow. So, if you''re heading there to play Warcraft, it might not be the best place. Then again, you probably wouldn''t actually head outside to go to a coffee shop, either.\r\n\r\nAnother great aspect is the presence of living, breathing people (not just spoiled robots), and at this place, the flow of humans is pretty constant. Of all the times I have visited, I''ve never seen it empty, and I like that. The steady murmur of conversation is the perfect soundtrack to get my work done. It definitely is a neighborhood staple, and you aren''t without choices on where to sit or plug in. There''s plenty of room in the coffee side, bar side, and there''s even a little patio outback where cigarettes tend to be smoked.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> Overall, it''s a good place, and I find myself recommending it often.

I know, I know, a suburban coffee shop, but bear with me...<!--more-->\r\n<h4><span class="first-words">The History</span></h4>\r\nFrom what I know about this place, its pedigree is traced back to Tacoma, Washington—not a bad place to come from, I suppose. Their self-description talks of being a vital part of the community and being inspired by Italy''s espresso culture, yada yada yada. Nearly everyone says that. Even Howard Schultz said that at one time and look where that got us. However, their expressed desire to be a neighborhood coffee shop seems to actually be working.\r\n<h4><span class="first-words">The Coffee</span></h4>\r\nMy standard first-time drink is usually an Americano or latte. In this case, the Americano is a wonderful baseline drink. If made correctly, you get a lovely crema, the hot water and espresso combination even out the flavor of the coffee, and let''s face it: espresso is gone way too fast. I''m not Italian, for Pete''s sake. I love espresso shots but will only drink it straight in places I really trust. To my delight, I heard the familiar banging of portafilters into bins, and I had a feeling I was in for a treat. The drink was produced and brought to my table, whereupon I viewed that  nice layer of crema. The flavor was good. Not amazing, but good. The espresso certainly embodied everything a fine espresso should: full body, slight bitterness, subtle caramel tones; but for me, the dimension didn''t go far enough. That''s hardly a negative, since the intensity of espresso is, after all, subjective.\r\n<h4><span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span></h4>\r\nFor once, this is a suburban coffee shop that is actually comfortable and has a hint of urban dinge that in my opinion, all the best coffee shops have. Sometimes, the dingier the better. The deep yellow-gold, black, copper and dark wood mix well to form a comfortable and inspiring atmosphere. Armed with a great comfy-couch area and plenty of tables (including outside seating) you definitely have your choice of places to sit. Mine, however, was by the fireplace. And that''s enough about the design, I drink coffee, after all.\r\n<h4><span class="first-words">The End</span></h4>\r\nFinally, the experience was punctuated by genuinely nice staff. I''ve been a few times, and even Bot1 has sneaked over there a couple times when I haven''t been looking. Witty small talk and a staff that calls  you by name on the second visit is a good step in the direction of having a lasting neighborhood coffee shop.<span class="end-icon">END</span>\r\n\r\n[mappress mapid="3"]', 'Forza Coffee', 'I was trying to decide which coffee house to review first for Coffee-Bot.

In the “no” camp, I know that coffee is not a stagnant entity easy to sum up. Coffee is more than just 98% water; it’s a culture, a way of life, a multidimensional beverage that changes by the seasons, countries and political uprisings. It is this complex personality that I love about coffee-always changing and morphing, yet somehow staying comfortably familiar regardless the venue in which it''s consumed.\r\n\r\nThat''s enough about me.

I say convinced, because I am a pretty staunch hot coffee kind of guy. Bot1 couldn''t compute the concept of cold coffee, and already being overheated from the 90 degree outside temps, inadvertently went into hibernate mode before his processor overheated. However, I accepted. The cold brew turned out to be exactly what I needed on that hot day. Unlike other iced coffees that I''ve had which usually capitalize on overwhelmingly acidic, citrus notes to fool you in to thinking you''re being refreshed, there was a general lack of acidity which was replaced with a surprisingly deep, smooth palette of caramel and earth tones. Not at all what I expected from a cold coffee. A hint of spice lingered on my tongue and the aftertaste, despite the overall intensity, was very pleasant. The flavor lasted, as well, and despite being slightly watered down from the ice, my last sip was just as good as the first. I was sold.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span>As for the other important aspects to the shop: service and atmosphere, there are a few more notes to ad. Since I was served by the owner, I was immediately engaged in pleasant conversation and was able to talk for a fair amount of time about coffee, asking questions, etc., and he was more than willing to chat. I get the vibe that it''s an atmosphere he tries to foster. And, speaking of atmosphere, well, you don''t go there for it. The tables were uncomfortable, especially for the lengthy amount of time I was there (waiting on Bot1 to wake up), the blue walls made me nervous, and the local art display, while well-intentioned, was haphazard and not well organized.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span><span style="color: #999999;"><em>(A note here: this original review was written back in July and I have since seen they are doing some work on the place, so the atmosphere complaint might be a moot point)</em></span> None of that would keep me from there, however, because this is the kind of coffee shop you go to for the superb coffee, you don''t have to go there for anything else.

Ultimately, I wasn''t going to expect much from the cup of coffee. The machine was automatic and they serve Illy coffee. Whenever I experience this kind of scenario, this usually translates to a very tame, albeit drinkable, cup of coffee. And I was right.

The double espresso disappointed slightly as well. The crema was thin and nearly immediately broke to reveal the dark body of the shot. The“raining” effect or separation of the shot was reminiscent of Guinness, which, as luck would have it, is served at Common Grounds as well. The flavor didn''t go deep enough either.

Oddly enough I felt like I was drinking a lime. Of course there were most of the typical espresso qualities, but the acidity was shocking!

Bot1 has no patience for traffic or mobs of people, and when confronted with such situations, his programmed reaction is to drive 30 mph over the speed limit in one direction--stopping for no one. That''s even more dangerous considering the amount of college students and left-over hippies riding around on bicycles in this town. Had he not erupted in such acutely emulated anger, we would never have stumbled across Jet''s Espressoria—quaintly situated slightly off the beaten path in Boulder, Colorado.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> An Americano was ordered, and it was presented to me in a mug and with a beautiful golden crema. As I sipped it, my mouth was filled with a wonderful rich, dense, and full-bodied flavor. It was exactly what I needed after riding in a Subaru with a crazed robot. The flavor held, and over the course of my stay the taste never turned extremely acidic, like some coffees tend to do as they cool. This was the work of a fine roast, great espresso skills, and a wonderful espresso machine. Based on a tweet from back in July, they serve Box Car Espresso, Novo Espresso, and Boulder Organic Espresso. For any of you who have read my other posts, you know you usually have me at “Novo”. Judging from the extremely steady stream of customers, they all agreed with the quality as well. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span> This place has a very local, neighborhood, some might say “indie” feel. I interpreted a loose 50''s vibe underscored by photographs of abandoned Route 66-style motels and gas stations, retro-looking tables and chairs and swirling ceiling fans. On the face of it, I personally am not a fan of this kind of look for a coffee shop, but I found myself quite comfortable and Bot1 felt he was among kin, being that most of his metal body work originated from the 50''s. It also had the dinge (which I''m beginning to think is a word I made up) factor I love so much: sketchy paint jobs, cluttered bar and counter, uneven tables and hand-written signs. It was also filled with the bicycle riding naturalists, designers, and college students that Bot1 nearly annihilated on the way over. In short, a great mix of people.\r\n\r\nJet''s Espressoria also bills itself as a bakery and their presentation of fine items was not lacking. Because of their $5 minimum for credit card use, I ordered a blueberry muffin as well. When I do these reviews I''m well aware that I am merely taking a snapshot of an overall experience and I allow quite a bit for less-than-great food, drink, or atmosphere, but this blueberry muffin was, well, not great. That said, I noticed most people going for their assortment of quiches and breakfast burritos which all looked wonderful, and next time I visit I will be digging in to one of these for sure. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> Overall this place was a killer find. The coffee quality is way up there and I am very willing to overlook the muffin disappointment in light of the fine coffee and atmosphere. The employees (owners?) were very friendly and seemed genuinely focused on providing an outstanding product. Bring cash or buy lots of stuff since they have a $5 charge minimum, and try it! <span class="end-icon">END</span>\r\n[mappress mapid="7"]\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>\r\n<hr />', 'Jet''s Espressoria', 'I discovered this place while trying to go to another coffee shop that was completely packed.

On first impression, this shop appears tidy, but worn and outdated—rather like your kitschy great-aunt’s 80s-tastic pastel dining room. The marble and cast-iron tables, though, are wonderfully stable for writing, playing chess, etc. (I scoff at Bot2’s affinity for wobbly furniture). The place was almost awkwardly quiet, but we were glad that there were only a handful of other early afternoon customers because the single barista, though rather adept at latte art, operated the manual espresso machine fairly slowly. In dealing with customers—including our delightful selves and some who were more than a little obnoxious—she upheld La Dolce Vita’s claim of being “Arvada’s friendliest coffeehouse,” without seeming overly pushy or fake.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> La Dolce Vita offers a pretty extensive selection of teas, espresso, and syrup flavors, as well as breakfast items and pastries, but I settled on a small americano (12oz. = $2.20). The espresso was very mild and smooth—perfectly adequate for a quick boost after shopping, though not a lot to savor. This shop does run specials (e.g. $1.75 lattes after 2pm) and provides a loyalty card to allow regulars to earn a free drink, which is always a plus in my rather sparse pocketbook.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere. </span>There were plenty of tables inside (and a handful on the sidewalk outside), so we choose a semi-private spot in the bay window. The general lack of outlets in this area seemed to distress Bot1 on principle, but I appreciated that the laptop creeper who wanted to share our table had to sit across the room (I imagine he couldn’t help gravitating toward bots, though I’ve resolved to practice looking unsavory).\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> If you go, a note of warning: there is a step from the café seating area down to the counter. For some reason, the glaring yellow signs warning me to watch my step proved difficult to read while I was falling on my face. In addition, La Dolce Vita plays host to a variety of local live music performances on most Saturdays, including the occasional “open mic night.” The music begins around 7pm, but if you want a seat, get there before the locals crowd in. <span class="end-icon">END</span>\r\n\r\n[mappress mapid="9"]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: center">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>', 'La Dolce Vita', 'After browsing the local shops of Olde Town Arvada for spools of copper wire (I didn’t ask), Bot1 and I decided to stop in La Dolce Vita for a restorative cuppa.

Bot1 has no patience for traffic or mobs of people, and when confronted with such a situation, his programmed reaction is to drive 30 mph over the speed limit in a single direction, stopping for no one. (Much like my father used to do, but I don''t see any real connection.) That''s even more dangerous considering the amount of college students and left-over hippies riding around on bicycles in this town. Had he not erupted in such acutely emulated anger, we never would have stumbled across Jet''s Espressoria—quaintly situated just off the beaten path in Boulder.\r\n\r\nThis place has a very local, neighborhood, some might say “indie” feel. There is a distinct kitschy 50''s feel punctuated with photographs of abandoned Route 66 style motels and gas stations, retro tables and chairs and swirling ceiling fans. On the face of it, I wouldn''t have thought that look would work well for a cozy shop, but I found myself quite comfortable and Bot1 felt among family being that most of his metal work originated from the 50''s. It also had the dinge (which I''m beginning to think is a word I made up) factor I love so much: fairly uneven floors, sketchy paint job, cluttered bar and counter, uneven tables and hand-written signs. It was also filled with the bicycle riding hippies and college students that Bot1 nearly annihilated. This is a mix that many of the more college-frequented joints don''t really have. \r\n\r\nThe coffee. An Americano was ordered, and it was presented to me in a mug and with a nice thick crema. As I sipped it, my mouth was filled with a  wonderful rich and full-bodied flavor. It was exactly what I needed after riding in a Subaru with a crazed robot. The flavor held, too, and over the course of my stay the flavor never turned extremely acidic, like some coffees tend to do. This was the work of a fine coffee, great espresso skills, and a wonderful machine. Judging from the extremely steady stream of customers, they agree with the quality as well. \r\n\r\nJet''s Espressoria also bills itself as a bakery and their presentation of fine items was not lacking. Because of their $5 minimum for credit card use, I ordered a blueberry muffin as well. When I do these reviews I''m well aware that I am merely taking a snapshot of an overall experience and I allow quite a bit for less-than-great food, drink, or atmosphere, but this blueberry muffin was horrible. What flavor it used to have had completely evaporated away leaving a dry memory of something once edible. I tried to finish it, but I couldn''t. That said, I noticed most people going for their assortment of quiches and breakfast burritos which all looked wonderful, and next time I visit I will be digging in to one of these for sure.\r\n\r\nOverall this place was a killer find. The coffee quality is way up there and I am super willing to overlook the muffin disappointment in light of the atmosphere and coffee.

We found ourselves at Folsom St. Coffee Co. This is a college joint through and through, and the day we visited it was its usual self: packed, hip...and green. According to their website, Folsom St. Coffee is “Boulder''s only true eco-friendly coffeehouse. Folsom St. Coffee Co. was awarded the Eco-Cycle award for ''Zero Waste or Darn Near'' as well as the "Waste Reduction" award from the Center For Resource Conservation.” I believe it, because when Bot1 tried to throw away his trash, his waste eliminating algorithm caused his CPU to overheat just trying to sort out which tub to throw what in.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As has become customary, a double espresso was ordered and Bot1 left to talk up a couple students who were sitting outside. The espresso presented to me had a deceivingly beautiful thick crema that held fast when I spooned some sugar on top. That was a good sign. The flavor, however, was a disappointment. Oddly enough I felt like I was drinking a lime. Of course there were most of the typical espresso qualities, but the acidity was shocking! I''d like to attribute this to the extraction of the shot, but I watched it pour and everything was on the up and up. The flavor evened out when it was in an Americano, but overall I wasn''t too impressed with the flavor.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span>Like many coffee shops, however, the experience doesn''t always center around the coffee, and ultimately Folsom St. Coffee delivered in other areas. The atmosphere was welcoming, cozy and was the sort of place in which I felt I could get motivated to finally write my 20 page single-spaced essay on the relationship between Pyongyang and Beijing. The muddled and haphazard decor actually cemented the cozy feeling, and that constant murmur of a packed coffee house was ideal for working, meeting friends, or simply sipping a cup of coffee. Complete with poetry, open mic nights and live music acts, this place is hopping a good part of every day, and the sort of place young hipsters like to frequent.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> Overall this coffee shop is very enjoyable, and despite being turned down three whole times, Bot1 vowed it wouldn''t keep him down and will definitely return.

That said, it was hot, and I needed something cool.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee</span> The person working there, who I later found out was the owner, convinced me to try what he called a "toddy", or a cold brewed coffee. I say convinced, because I am a pretty staunch hot coffee kind of guy. Bot1 couldn''t compute the concept of cold coffee, and already being overheated from the 90 degree outside temps, inadvertently went into hibernate mode before his processor overheated. However, I accepted. The cold brew turned out to be exactly what I needed on that hot day. Unlike other iced coffees that I''ve had which usually capitalize on overwhelmingly acidic, citrus notes to fool you in to thinking you''re being refreshed, there was a general lack of acidity which was replaced with a surprisingly deep, smooth palette of caramel and earth tones. Not at all what I expected from a cold coffee. A hint of spice lingered on my tongue and the aftertaste, despite the overall intensity, was very pleasant. The flavor lasted, as well, and despite being slightly watered down from the ice, my last sip was just as good as the first. I was sold.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span>As for the other important aspects to the shop: service and atmosphere, there are a few more notes to ad. Since I was served by the owner, I was immediately engaged in pleasant conversation and was able to talk for a fair amount of time about coffee, asking questions, etc., and he was more than willing to chat. I get the vibe that it''s an atmosphere he tries to foster. And, speaking of atmosphere, well, you don''t go there for it. The tables were uncomfortable, especially for the lengthy amount of time I was there (waiting on Bot1 to wake up), the blue walls made me nervous, and the local art display, while well-intentioned, was haphazard and not well organized.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span><span style="color: #999999;"><em>(A note here: this original review was written back in July and I have since seen they are doing some work on the place, so the atmosphere complaint might be a moot point)</em></span> None of that would keep me from there, however, because this is the kind of coffee shop you go to for the superb coffee, you don''t have to go there for anything else.

Bot1 has no patience for traffic or mobs of people, and when confronted with such situations, his programmed reaction is to drive 30 mph over the speed limit in one direction-stopping for no one. That''s even more dangerous considering the amount of college students and left-over hippies riding around on bicycles in this town. Had he not erupted in such acutely emulated anger, we would never have stumbled across Jet''s Espressoria—quaintly situated slightly off the beaten path in Boulder, Colorado.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> An Americano was ordered, and it was presented to me in a mug and with a beautiful golden crema. As I sipped it, my mouth was filled with a wonderful rich, dense, and full-bodied flavor. It was exactly what I needed after riding in a Subaru with a crazed robot. The flavor held, and over the course of my stay the taste never turned extremely acidic, like some coffees tend to do as they cool. This was the work of a fine roast, great espresso skills, and a wonderful espresso machine. Based on a tweet from back in July, they serve Box Car Espresso, Novo Espresso, and Boulder Organic Espresso. For any of you who have read my other posts, you know you usually have me at “Novo”. Judging from the extremely steady stream of customers, they all agreed with the quality as well. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span> This place has a very local, neighborhood, some might say “indie” feel. I interpreted a loose 50''s vibe underscored by photographs of abandoned Route 66-style motels and gas stations, retro-looking tables and chairs and swirling ceiling fans. On the face of it, I personally am not a fan of this kind of look for a coffee shop, but I found myself quite comfortable and Bot1 felt he was among kin, being that most of his metal body work originated from the 50''s. It also had the dinge (which I''m beginning to think is a word I made up) factor I love so much: sketchy paint jobs, cluttered bar and counter, uneven tables and hand-written signs. It was also filled with the bicycle riding naturalists, designers, and college students that Bot1 nearly annihilated on the way over. In short, a great mix of people.\r\n\r\nJet''s Espressoria also bills itself as a bakery and their presentation of fine items was not lacking. Because of their $5 minimum for credit card use, I ordered a blueberry muffin as well. When I do these reviews I''m well aware that I am merely taking a snapshot of an overall experience and I allow quite a bit for less-than-great food, drink, or atmosphere, but this blueberry muffin was, well, not great. That said, I noticed most people going for their assortment of quiches and breakfast burritos which all looked wonderful, and next time I visit I will be digging in to one of these for sure. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> Overall this place was a killer find.

That said, it was hot, and I needed something cool.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee</span> The person working there, who I later found out was the owner, convinced me to try what he called a "toddy", or a cold brewed coffee. I say convinced, because I am a pretty staunch hot coffee kind of guy. Bot1 couldn''t compute the concept of cold coffee, and already being overheated from the 90 degree outside temps, inadvertently went into hibernate mode before his processor overheated. However, I accepted. The cold brew turned out to be exactly what I needed on that hot day. Unlike other iced coffees that I''ve had which usually capitalize on overwhelmingly acidic, citrus notes to fool you in to thinking you''re being refreshed, there was a general lack of acidity which was replaced with a surprisingly deep, smooth palette of caramel and earth tones. Not at all what I expected from a cold coffee. A hint of spice lingered on my tongue and the aftertaste, despite the overall intensity, was very pleasant. The flavor lasted, as well, and despite being slightly watered down from the ice, my last sip was just as good as the first. I was sold.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span>As for the other important aspects to the shop: service and atmosphere, there are a few more notes to ad. Since I was served by the owner, I was immediately engaged in pleasant conversation and was able to talk for a fair amount of time about coffee, asking questions, etc., and he was more than willing to chat. I get the vibe that it''s an atmosphere he tries to foster. And, speaking of atmosphere, well, you don''t go there for it. The tables were uncomfortable, especially for the lengthy amount of time I was there (waiting on Bot1 to wake up), the blue walls made me nervous, and the local art display, while well-intentioned, was haphazard and not well organized.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span><span style="color: #999999;"><em>(A note here: this original review was written back in July and I have since seen they are doing some work on the place, so the atmosphere complaint might be a moot point)</em></span> None of that would keep me from there, however, because this is the kind of coffee shop you go to for the superb coffee, you don''t have to go there for anything else. I strongly recommend you go and enjoy some of the highest quality coffee available here at 5,280 feet. <span class="end-icon">END</span>\r\n\r\n[mappress mapid="2"]', 'Two Rivers Coffee', 'On a very hot day back in July I came across Two Rivers Coffee.

A little bored, Bot1 insisted we consult my very-cute-coffee-name-pun list</span> to see if something piqued our interest, and it was then we decided on Common Grounds Coffee House. <a href="http://coffeebot.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/deathbeam.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-308" title="deathbeam" src="http://coffeebot.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/deathbeam.jpg" alt="deathbeam" width="250" height="188" /></a>While usually passionate about the coffee (passion being one of Bot1''s few emulated emotions), Bot1 was more interested in reading “Death Beam”, a title he''d spotted on the bookshelf, and while I always try to discourage him reading anything with “death” in it, I decided to pick my battle and allow it. Bot1 then marched up to the counter, emitted his demand for a whole milk latte and a double espresso, beamed the book off the shelf, and proceeded to process the pages via his OCR scanner.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As usual, I was left with the coffee. The person who made the drinks was extremely friendly (bonus) and after a pleasant interaction about the weather she proceeded to focus in on the latte. I noticed she took much care when steaming the milk and while I couldn''t see the shots as they were extracted, the aroma was enticing and the shots were swiftly combined with the milk. I was given the latte which embodied thick, dense foam, slight hints of brown espresso swirled through the mix, and a warmth that was comforting on that chilly day. Ultimately, however, the flavor, while it didn''t disappoint, was only average. To be certain, it was a good latte—one I would return for—but  once again the reality was that to have truly impressive beverages, the coffee itself must be spectacular, and it just wasn''t. The double espresso disappointed slightly as well. The crema was thin and nearly immediately broke to reveal the dark body of the shot. The“raining” effect or separation of the shot was reminiscent of Guinness, which, as luck would have it, is served at Common Grounds as well. The flavor didn''t go deep enough either. The initial stark bitterness never really left my tongue and the acidity was slightly overwhelming, so much so that any dimension that might have been there was masked by this intensity.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span> Common Grounds embodied a balanced mix of the old and new. The counter and bar were your typical curvy-bistro-coolness with lots of angles thrown in that made for exciting visuals. There was plenty of room to sprawl out on one of their two very large tables, or keep to yourself on any one of their abundant four-seaters. One feature Bot1 and I liked a lot was the presence of bookshelves with actual physical books. On top of that, if one so desired, one could pick up and read...one. During my visit I did notice a young guy in skinny pants with his Mac under his arm stroking his chin in silent wonder at the spectacle of these books, but for the most part people knew what to do with them. Large windows overlooking the busy street allowed generous amounts of light in, illuminating the local art canvases aiding in a vibrant feel; and the constant murmur of machines, music, and conversation were all at the perfect level.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> Common Grounds Coffee House withstands the test. Sure, I wasn''t bowled over by the coffee, but in the end it was <em>good</em>. Combined with the atmosphere and friendliness of the employees, it''s definitely a place you should check out. Bot1 agrees and also informed me “Death Beam” didn''t live up to his planet domination aspirations...much to my relief.<span class="end-icon">END</span>\r\n\r\n[mappress mapid="4"]<!--more-->', 'Common Grounds Coffee House', 'It was a quiet day.

I know, I know, a suburban coffee shop, but bear with me...<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The History</span> From what I know about this place, its pedigree is traced back to Tacoma, Washington—not a bad place to come from, I suppose. Their self-description talks of being a vital part of the community and being inspired by Italy''s espresso culture, yada yada yada. Nearly everyone says that. Even Howard Schultz said that at one time and look where that got us. However, their expressed desire to be a neighborhood coffee shop seems to actually be working.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee</span> My standard first-time drink is usually an Americano or latte. In this case, the Americano is a wonderful baseline drink. If made correctly, you get a lovely crema, the hot water and espresso combination even out the flavor of the coffee, and let''s face it: espresso is gone way too fast. I''m not Italian, for Pete''s sake. I love espresso shots but will only drink it straight in places I really trust. To my delight, I heard the familiar banging of portafilters into bins, and I had a feeling I was in for a treat. The drink was produced and brought to my table, whereupon I viewed that  nice layer of crema. The flavor was good. Not amazing, but good. The espresso certainly embodied everything a fine espresso should: full body, slight bitterness, subtle caramel tones; but for me, the dimension didn''t go far enough. That''s hardly a negative, since the intensity of espresso is, after all, subjective.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> For once, this is a suburban coffee shop that is actually comfortable and has a hint of urban dinge that in my opinion, all the best coffee shops have. Sometimes, the dingier the better. The deep yellow-gold, black, copper and dark wood mix well to form a comfortable and inspiring atmosphere. Armed with a great comfy-couch area and plenty of tables (including outside seating) you definitely have your choice of places to sit. Mine, however, was by the fireplace. And that''s enough about the design, I drink coffee, after all.\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> Finally, the experience was punctuated by genuinely nice staff. I''ve been a few times, and even Bot1 has sneaked over there a couple times when I haven''t been looking. Witty small talk and a staff that calls  you by name on the second visit is a good step in the direction of having a lasting neighborhood coffee shop.<span class="end-icon">END</span>\r\n\r\n[mappress mapid="3"]', 'Forza Coffee', 'I was trying to decide which coffee house to review first for Coffee-Bot.

If you remember back to his reading of “Death Beam” a few <a href="http://coffeebot.co/coffee-shop-reviews/common-grounds-coffee-house-3/">posts</a> ago, you know that I try to discourage anything that might be violent or illegal...or involve the word “death”. He may be a caffeine-converted robot, but there is no escaping what he was originally built for. However, I digress.\r\n\r\nIllegal Grounds, despite its name which implies a certain badness coupled with scary tattoos (or maybe the fact it was started by a lawyer?), is a very tame and inviting neighborhood coffee shop. Situated on the ground floor of an old Victorian house,  it embodies all the charms of a local favorite. Upon entrance, you walk straight down a hallway to the counter, and in my case, was met by a very friendly employee.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> An Americano was ordered and with it in hand, I turned the corner, entered the living room, and flopped down on one of the couches. Ultimately, I wasn''t going to expect much from the cup of coffee. The machine was automatic and they serve Illy coffee. Whenever I experience this kind of scenario, this usually translates to a very tame, albeit drinkable, cup of coffee. And I was right. There were no overwhelming flavors or distinctions to the espresso, just utilitarian goodness. I know I sound snooty when I immediately dismiss a beverage produced from an automatic machine, especially since this blog is called "Coffee Bot" which implies a certain level of automation, but understand that ultimately it is the human element in the creation of a beverage that gives it its ultimate dimension and uniqueness. It''s that human element that fuels my passion for exceptional coffee.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span> The atmosphere didn''t disappoint. Once I rounded the corner into the seating area (or living room), I was immediately impressed with how many tables and chairs could fit amid the cozy space. A large picture window at the end of the room gave a bright, framed view of 17th street, and the light that poured in lit the walls full of local art. Wood floors, quiet music and a plentiful supply of power strips made Illegal Grounds a perfect spot to hunker down and get straight to conversation, work, or relaxation. <em>Take note: this place was pretty quiet despite the small crowd. To that end, if you are going to discuss the party habits of fellow world leaders and don''t want your secrets ending up on Wikileaks, this might not be the right place for those conversations. Alternatively, you could sit outside on the covered porch-there are far less people there. </em>\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> Even though Bot1 didn''t fit easily between the tables and chairs, I would say our visit was a success and we will definitely return. The coffee gets the job done, the employees were very friendly,  and the atmosphere makes you want to hang around a little longer than you might at another coffee shop. <span class="end-icon">END</span>\r\n[mappress mapid="8"]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>', 'Illegal Grounds ', '<a href="http://coffeebot.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/illegal-grounds.jpg"><img src="http://coffeebot.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/illegal-grounds.jpg" alt="Illegal Grounds Coffee Shop" title="illegal-grounds" width="528" height="200" class="size-full wp-image-365" /></a>\r\nIllegal Grounds, despite its name which implies a certain badness coupled with scary tattoos (or maybe the fact it was started by a lawyer?), is a very tame and inviting neighborhood coffee shop.

Bot1 has no patience for traffic or mobs of people, and when confronted with such situations, his programmed reaction is to drive 30 mph over the speed limit in one direction--stopping for no one. That''s even more dangerous considering the amount of college students and left-over hippies riding around on bicycles in this town. Had he not erupted in such acutely emulated anger, we would never have stumbled across Jet''s Espressoria—quaintly situated slightly off the beaten path in Boulder, Colorado.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> An Americano was ordered, and it was presented to me in a mug and with a beautiful golden crema. As I sipped it, my mouth was filled with a wonderful rich, dense, and full-bodied flavor. It was exactly what I needed after riding in a Subaru with a crazed robot. The flavor held, and over the course of my stay the taste never turned extremely acidic, like some coffees tend to do as they cool. This was the work of a fine roast, great espresso skills, and a wonderful espresso machine. Based on a tweet from back in July, they serve Box Car Espresso, Novo Espresso, and Boulder Organic Espresso. For any of you who have read my other posts, you know you usually have me at “Novo”. Judging from the extremely steady stream of customers, they all agreed with the quality as well. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span> This place has a very local, neighborhood, some might say “indie” feel. I interpreted a loose 50''s vibe underscored by photographs of abandoned Route 66-style motels and gas stations, retro-looking tables and chairs and swirling ceiling fans. On the face of it, I personally am not a fan of this kind of look for a coffee shop, but I found myself quite comfortable and Bot1 felt he was among kin, being that most of his metal body work originated from the 50''s. It also had the dinge (which I''m beginning to think is a word I made up) factor I love so much: sketchy paint jobs, cluttered bar and counter, uneven tables and hand-written signs. It was also filled with the bicycle riding naturalists, designers, and college students that Bot1 nearly annihilated on the way over. In short, a great mix of people.\r\n\r\nJet''s Espressoria also bills itself as a bakery and their presentation of fine items was not lacking. Because of their $5 minimum for credit card use, I ordered a blueberry muffin as well. When I do these reviews I''m well aware that I am merely taking a snapshot of an overall experience and I allow quite a bit for less-than-great food, drink, or atmosphere, but this blueberry muffin was, well, not great. That said, I noticed most people going for their assortment of quiches and breakfast burritos which all looked wonderful, and next time I visit I will be digging in to one of these for sure. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> Overall this place was a killer find. The coffee quality is way up there and I am very willing to overlook the muffin disappointment in light of the fine coffee and atmosphere. The employees (owners?) were very friendly and seemed genuinely focused on providing an outstanding product. Bring cash or buy lots of stuff since they have a $5 charge minimum, and try it! <span class="end-icon">END</span>\r\n[mappress mapid="7"]\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>\r\n<hr />', 'Jet''s Espressoria', 'I discovered this place while trying to go to another coffee shop that was completely packed.

We found ourselves at Folsom St. Coffee Co. This is a college joint through and through, and the day we visited it was its usual self: packed, hip...and green. According to their website, Folsom St. Coffee is “Boulder''s only true eco-friendly coffeehouse. Folsom St. Coffee Co. was awarded the Eco-Cycle award for ''Zero Waste or Darn Near'' as well as the "Waste Reduction" award from the Center For Resource Conservation.” I believe it, because when Bot1 tried to throw away his trash, his waste eliminating algorithm caused his CPU to overheat just trying to sort out which tub to throw what in.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As has become customary, a double espresso was ordered and Bot1 left to talk up a couple students who were sitting outside. The espresso presented to me had a deceivingly beautiful thick crema that held fast when I spooned some sugar on top. That was a good sign. The flavor, however, was a disappointment. Oddly enough I felt like I was drinking a lime. Of course there were most of the typical espresso qualities, but the acidity was shocking! I''d like to attribute this to the extraction of the shot, but I watched it pour and everything was on the up and up. The flavor evened out when it was in an Americano, but overall I wasn''t too impressed with the flavor.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span>Like many coffee shops, however, the experience doesn''t always center around the coffee, and ultimately Folsom St. Coffee delivered in other areas. The atmosphere was welcoming, cozy and was the sort of place in which I felt I could get motivated to finally write my 20 page single-spaced essay on the relationship between Pyongyang and Beijing. The muddled and haphazard decor actually cemented the cozy feeling, and that constant murmur of a packed coffee house was ideal for working, meeting friends, or simply sipping a cup of coffee. Complete with poetry, open mic nights and live music acts, this place is hopping a good part of every day, and the sort of place young hipsters like to frequent.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> Overall this coffee shop is very enjoyable, and despite being turned down three whole times, Bot1 vowed it wouldn''t keep him down and will definitely return.

Even though we ordered a small, it came in a nice big mug, and after some detailed chemical analysis, Bot1 concluded the cinnamon on top of the foam was in fact, cinnamon. A nice touch, but if you don''t like people putting spices on your coffee, you might mention that upon ordering. After this, he lost interest, went over to the bar, and I was left to do the tasting by myself.\r\n\r\nThe latte was...good; nothing amazing. The foam was a tad bubbly and I would have liked more espresso presence, but the flavor that was there was smooth and balanced, so I can''t really complain. This isn''t an artisan place, so I didn''t detect much passion for coffee itself; I understand that coffee passion isn''t necessarily the point to the place.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> The main thing about this joint is that you can come in, set up your lappy, and do what you do best: hit up Facebook. Keep in mind that most people who sit there for a while are also on their laptops, so the connection speed is pretty slow. So, if you''re heading there to play Warcraft, it might not be the best place. Then again, you probably wouldn''t actually head outside to go to a coffee shop, either.\r\n\r\nAnother great aspect is the presence of living, breathing people (not just spoiled robots), and at this place, the flow of humans is pretty constant. Of all the times I have visited, I''ve never seen it empty, and I like that. The steady murmur of conversation is the perfect soundtrack to get my work done. It definitely is a neighborhood staple, and you aren''t without choices on where to sit or plug in. There''s plenty of room in the coffee side, bar side, and there''s even a little patio outback where cigarettes tend to be smoked.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> Overall, it''s a good place, and I find myself recommending it often.

I say convinced, because I am a pretty staunch hot coffee kind of guy. Bot1 couldn''t compute the concept of cold coffee, and already being overheated from the 90 degree outside temps, inadvertently went into hibernate mode before his processor overheated. However, I accepted. The cold brew turned out to be exactly what I needed on that hot day. Unlike other iced coffees that I''ve had which usually capitalize on overwhelmingly acidic, citrus notes to fool you in to thinking you''re being refreshed, there was a general lack of acidity which was replaced with a surprisingly deep, smooth palette of caramel and earth tones. Not at all what I expected from a cold coffee. A hint of spice lingered on my tongue and the aftertaste, despite the overall intensity, was very pleasant. The flavor lasted, as well, and despite being slightly watered down from the ice, my last sip was just as good as the first. I was sold.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span>As for the other important aspects to the shop: service and atmosphere, there are a few more notes to ad. Since I was served by the owner, I was immediately engaged in pleasant conversation and was able to talk for a fair amount of time about coffee, asking questions, etc., and he was more than willing to chat. I get the vibe that it''s an atmosphere he tries to foster. And, speaking of atmosphere, well, you don''t go there for it. The tables were uncomfortable, especially for the lengthy amount of time I was there (waiting on Bot1 to wake up), the blue walls made me nervous, and the local art display, while well-intentioned, was haphazard and not well organized.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span><span style="color: #999999;"><em>(A note here: this original review was written back in July and I have since seen they are doing some work on the place, so the atmosphere complaint might be a moot point)</em></span> None of that would keep me from there, however, because this is the kind of coffee shop you go to for the superb coffee, you don''t have to go there for anything else.

In this case, the Americano is a wonderful baseline drink. If made correctly, you get a lovely crema, the hot water and espresso combination even out the flavor of the coffee, and let''s face it: espresso is gone way too fast. I''m not Italian, for Pete''s sake. I love espresso shots but will only drink it straight in places I really trust. To my delight, I heard the familiar banging of portafilters into bins, and I had a feeling I was in for a treat. The drink was produced and brought to my table, whereupon I viewed that  nice layer of crema. The flavor was good. Not amazing, but good. The espresso certainly embodied everything a fine espresso should: full body, slight bitterness, subtle caramel tones; but for me, the dimension didn''t go far enough. That''s hardly a negative, since the intensity of espresso is, after all, subjective.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> For once, this is a suburban coffee shop that is actually comfortable and has a hint of urban dinge that in my opinion, all the best coffee shops have. Sometimes, the dingier the better. The deep yellow-gold, black, copper and dark wood mix well to form a comfortable and inspiring atmosphere. Armed with a great comfy-couch area and plenty of tables (including outside seating) you definitely have your choice of places to sit. Mine, however, was by the fireplace. And that''s enough about the design, I drink coffee, after all.\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> Finally, the experience was punctuated by genuinely nice staff. I''ve been a few times, and even Bot1 has sneaked over there a couple times when I haven''t been looking. Witty small talk and a staff that calls  you by name on the second visit is a good step in the direction of having a lasting neighborhood coffee shop.<span class="end-icon">END</span>\r\n[mappress mapid="3"]\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>', 'Forza Coffee', 'I was trying to decide which coffee house to review first for Coffee-Bot.

We found ourselves at Folsom St. Coffee Co. This is a college joint through and through, and the day we visited it was its usual self: packed, hip...and green. According to their website, Folsom St. Coffee is “Boulder''s only true eco-friendly coffeehouse. Folsom St. Coffee Co. was awarded the Eco-Cycle award for ''Zero Waste or Darn Near'' as well as the "Waste Reduction" award from the Center For Resource Conservation.” I believe it, because when Bot1 tried to throw away his trash, his waste eliminating algorithm caused his CPU to overheat just trying to sort out which tub to throw what in.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As has become customary, a double espresso was ordered and Bot1 left to talk up a couple students who were sitting outside. The espresso presented to me had a deceivingly beautiful thick crema that held fast when I spooned some sugar on top. That was a good sign. The flavor, however, was a disappointment. Oddly enough I felt like I was drinking a lime. Of course there were most of the typical espresso qualities, but the acidity was shocking! I''d like to attribute this to the extraction of the shot, but I watched it pour and everything was on the up and up. The flavor evened out when it was in an Americano, but overall I wasn''t too impressed with the flavor.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span>Like many coffee shops, however, the experience doesn''t always center around the coffee, and ultimately Folsom St. Coffee delivered in other areas. The atmosphere was welcoming, cozy and was the sort of place in which I felt I could get motivated to finally write my 20 page single-spaced essay on the relationship between Pyongyang and Beijing. The muddled and haphazard decor actually cemented the cozy feeling, and that constant murmur of a packed coffee house was ideal for working, meeting friends, or simply sipping a cup of coffee.

The person who made the drinks was extremely friendly (bonus) and after a pleasant interaction about the weather she proceeded to focus in on the latte. I noticed she took much care when steaming the milk and while I couldn''t see the shots as they were extracted, the aroma was enticing and the shots were swiftly combined with the milk. I was given the latte which embodied thick, dense foam, slight hints of brown espresso swirled through the mix, and a warmth that was comforting on that chilly day. Ultimately, however, the flavor, while it didn''t disappoint, was only average. To be certain, it was a good latte—one I would return for—but  once again the reality was that to have truly impressive beverages, the coffee itself must be spectacular, and it just wasn''t. The double espresso disappointed slightly as well. The crema was thin and nearly immediately broke to reveal the dark body of the shot. The“raining” effect or separation of the shot was reminiscent of Guinness, which, as luck would have it, is served at Common Grounds as well. The flavor didn''t go deep enough either. The initial stark bitterness never really left my tongue and the acidity was slightly overwhelming, so much so that any dimension that might have been there was masked by this intensity.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span> Common Grounds embodied a balanced mix of the old and new. The counter and bar were your typical curvy-bistro-coolness with lots of angles thrown in that made for exciting visuals. There was plenty of room to sprawl out on one of their two very large tables, or keep to yourself on any one of their abundant four-seaters. One feature Bot1 and I liked a lot was the presence of bookshelves with actual physical books. On top of that, if one so desired, one could pick up and read...one. During my visit I did notice a young guy in skinny pants with his Mac under his arm stroking his chin in silent wonder at the spectacle of these books, but for the most part people knew what to do with them. Large windows overlooking the busy street allowed generous amounts of light in, illuminating the local art canvases aiding in a vibrant feel; and the constant murmur of machines, music, and conversation were all at the perfect level.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> Common Grounds Coffee House withstands the test. Sure, I wasn''t bowled over by the coffee, but in the end it was <em>good</em>. Combined with the atmosphere and friendliness of the employees, it''s definitely a place you should check out.

I do this because the crema is the soul of the espresso. Without it you are simply confronted with a dark and formless beverage that leaves you hovering over the face of some sort of liquid void. Crema contains the flavorful, complex, and oily soul of the espresso shot. It''s the lifeblood and excitement of coffee itself. \r\n\r\nThat said, when Bot1 discovered an entire coffee shop named after this beauty, it was a no-brainer, or in Bot1''s case, a no-CPUer that we check it out. Everything this shop does, it does well. The website, branding, interior design and ultimately, the coffee are nothing short of stellar. Bot1 is programmed to respond to excellence by demanding we go back again, and again, and again since it triggers an infinite system loop. Right off the bat, I''d recommend you do the same. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As we entered Crema (nestled in the Five Points area, or NoDo) I was struck by the overall simplicity and itty-bitty-ness of the place. The counter is no more than four paces from the front door and the menu is purposefully sparse—not only in its lack of fluff beverages but also in the fact that it is printed on the wall. It was immediately apparent the owner is a purist. For instance, this is not the shop for suburban frappu-whatever drinkers. Crema offers only three flavors: mocha, vanilla and caramel. It''s the equivalent to restoring peace to the world by neutralizing one coffee-assassinating flavor at a time. However, other than the occasional mocha, I don''t flavor my coffee, therefore my Americano was ordered. The lever was pulled, the shots were extracted, and the drink slid across the counter to me. The liquid rocked easily back and forth in the ceramic with the thick crema surface holding together tightly reflecting deep, red-brown and golden swirls. It glistened with the oily coffee bean residue (crema is the only time ''oil'' and ''residue'' are good things as descriptors), hinting at the flavor that was to come. Butter, caramel, crisp acidity and subtle bitterness filled my taste buds and for the first time in a very long time, I savored every single ounce of that Americano. (It''s at this point I should mention the espresso was a Novo roast. Sound familiar? Other roasters who make an appearance at Crema are Herkimer and Pablo''s- according to the website, that is.)\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> is what it is. Clearly underground, it is cold, utilitarian and industrial with a few reclaimed odds and ends. The tables and chairs have that certain retro flair, and I''m pretty sure they are original stuff, not overpriced re-makes. Hip below-ground art adorned the brick/plaster walls when I first visited, and the room was quite bright thanks to a fairly large red-pained window in the front. I had a bit of trouble finding an outlet for my laptop and finally found one behind a couch, but I noticed plenty of people on their Macs not bothered by this who apparently have risen above the need for a plug. Who needs an outlet, though? This is the sort of place you go to sip your velvety microfoam and discuss bands that don''t exist yet, not necessarily type up your doctoral thesis. There is a tiny bar that you can belly up to and watch the Baristas fashion their creations, and overall, considering the square footage, there is a good amount of seating for the size.\r\n\r\nFinally, a few points to note: First, you don''t go there if you are in a rush. It''s obvious the owner is more interested in the beverage quality than in the fact you forgot to set your alarm, spent too much time watching Kardashians reruns and are now running late for work. Every drink is made one-at-a time which maximizes quality but not speediness. In fact, if you are ordering a latte or cappuccino, each will include some sort of latte design, even if you are slapping a lid on it. Second, Crema''s muffins are insanely good and as a bonus they don''t have the paper wrapper around the bottom so you don''t have to peel it off. Let me tell you, this is reason enough to go there! Finally, they have a great selection of fine teas, but that review is up to TeaBot, not me, and TeaBot doesn''t even exist...yet.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> In conclusion: go there. No excuses, just go. You won''t regret it. \r\n[mappress mapid="10"]\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: center">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>\r\n<h2>Have you been to Crema?

I do this because the crema is the soul of the espresso. Without it you are simply confronted with a dark and formless beverage that leaves you hovering over the face of some sort of liquid void. Crema contains the flavorful, complex, and oily soul of the espresso shot. It''s the lifeblood, and without the crema we wouldn''t know coffee like we do today. \r\n\r\nThat said, when Bot1 and I discovered an entire coffee shop named after this beauty, it was a no-brainer, or in Bot1''s case, and no-CPUer that we check it out. Everything this shop does, it does well. The website, branding, interior design and ultimately, the beverage are nothing of stellar. Bot1 is programmed to respond to excellence by demanding we go back again, and again, and again since it triggers an infinite loop. Right off the bat, I''d recommend you do the same. \r\n\r\n<span class=”first-words”>The Coffee.</span> As we entered Crema (nestled in the Five Points area, or NoDo) I was struck by the overall simplicity and itty-bitty-ness of the place. The counter is no more than four paces from the front door and the menu is purposefully sparse—not only in it''s lack of fluff beverages but also in the fact that it is printed on the wall. It was immediately apparent the owner is a  purist. For instance, this is not the shop for suburban frappu-whatever drinkers. Crema offers only three flavors: mocha, vanilla and caramel. It''s the equivalent to restoring peace to the world by neutralizing one coffee-assassinating flavor at a time. However, other than the occasional mocha, I don''t flavor my coffee, therefore my Americano was ordered. The lever was pulled, the shots were extracted, and the drink slid across the counter to me. The liquid rocked easily back and forth in the ceramic with the thick crema surface holding together tightly reflecting deep, red-brown and golden swirls. It glistened with the oily coffee bean residue (crema is the only time ''oil'' and ''residue'' are good things as descriptors), hinting at the flavor that was to come. Butter, caramel, slight smokiness, crisp acidity and a subtly bitter, the deep body filled my taste buds and for the first time in a very long time, I savored every single ounce of that Americano. It''s at this point I should mention the espresso was a Novo roast. Sound familiar? Other roasters who make an appearance at Crema are Herkimer and Pablo''s- according to the website, that is.\r\n\r\n<span class=”first-words”>The Atmosphere</span> is what it is. Clearly underground, it is cold, utilitarian, industrial and full of reclaimed odds and ends. The tables and chairs have that certain retro flair, and I''m pretty sure they are original stuff, not overpriced re-makes. Hip below-ground art adorned the brick/plaster walls when I first visited, and the room was quite bright thanks to a fairly large red-pained window in the front. I had a bit of trouble finding an outlet for my laptop and finally found one stuck around behind a couch, but I noticed plenty of people on their Macs not bothered by this lack who apparently have risen above the need for a plug. This is the sort of place you go to sip your velvety microfoam and discuss bands that don''t exist yet, not necessarily type up your doctoral thesis. There is a tiny bar that you can belly up to and watch the Baristas fashion their creations, and overall, considering the square footage, there is a good amount of seating for the size.\r\n\r\nFinally, a few points to note: First, you don''t go there if you are in a rush. It''s obvious the owner is more interested in the beverage quality than in the fact you forgot to set your alarm, spent too much time watching Regis and Kelly and are now running late for work. Every drink is made one-at-a time which maximizes quality but not speediness. In fact, if you are ordering a latte or cappuccino, every drink will also include some latte art, even if you are slapping a lid on it. Also Crema''s muffins are insanely good and as a bonus they don''t have the paper wrapper around the bottom so you don''t have to peel it off. Let me tell you, this is reason enough to go there! Finally, they have a great selection of fine teas, but that review is up to TeaBot, not me. \r\n\r\n<span class=”first-words”>The End</span> In conclusion: go there. No excuses, just go.

I do this because the crema is the soul of the espresso. Without it you are simply confronted with a dark and formless beverage that leaves you hovering over the face of some sort of liquid void. Crema contains the flavorful, complex, and oily soul of the espresso shot. It''s the lifeblood, and without the crema we wouldn''t know coffee like we do today. \r\n\r\nThat said, when Bot1 and I discovered an entire coffee shop named after this beauty, it was a no-brainer, or in Bot1''s case, and no-CPUer that we check it out. Everything this shop does, it does well. The website, branding, interior design and ultimately, the beverage are nothing of stellar. Bot1 is programmed to respond to excellence by demanding we go back again, and again, and again since it triggers an infinite loop. Right off the bat, I''d recommend you do the same. \r\n\r\n<span class=”first-words”>The Coffee.</span> As we entered Crema (nestled in the Five Points area, or NoDo) I was struck by the overall simplicity and itty-bitty-ness of the place. The counter is no more than four paces from the front door and the menu is purposefully sparse—not only in it''s lack of fluff beverages but also in the fact that it is printed on the wall. It was immediately apparent the owner is a  purist. For instance, this is not the shop for suburban frappu-whatever drinkers. Crema offers only three flavors: mocha, vanilla and caramel. It''s the equivalent to restoring peace to the world by neutralizing one coffee-assassinating flavor at a time. However, other than the occasional mocha, I don''t flavor my coffee, therefore my Americano was ordered. The lever was pulled, the shots were extracted, and the drink slid across the counter to me. The liquid rocked easily back and forth in the ceramic with the thick crema surface holding together tightly reflecting deep, red-brown and golden swirls. It glistened with the oily coffee bean residue (crema is the only time ''oil'' and ''residue'' are good things as descriptors), hinting at the flavor that was to come. Butter, caramel, slight smokiness, crisp acidity and a subtly bitter, the deep body filled my taste buds and for the first time in a very long time, I savored every single ounce of that Americano. It''s at this point I should mention the espresso was a Novo roast. Sound familiar? Other roasters who make an appearance at Crema are Herkimer and Pablo''s- according to the website, that is.\r\n\r\n<span class=”first-words”>The Atmosphere</span> is what it is. Clearly underground, it is cold, utilitarian, industrial and full of reclaimed odds and ends. The tables and chairs have that certain retro flair, and I''m pretty sure they are original stuff, not overpriced re-makes. Hip below-ground art adorned the brick/plaster walls when I first visited, and the room was quite bright thanks to a fairly large red-pained window in the front. I had a bit of trouble finding an outlet for my laptop and finally found one stuck around behind a couch, but I noticed plenty of people on their Macs not bothered by this lack who apparently have risen above the need for a plug. This is the sort of place you go to sip your velvety microfoam and discuss bands that don''t exist yet, not necessarily type up your doctoral thesis. There is a tiny bar that you can belly up to and watch the Baristas fashion their creations, and overall, considering the square footage, there is a good amount of seating for the size.\r\n\r\nFinally, a few points to note: First, you don''t go there if you are in a rush. It''s obvious the owner is more interested in the beverage quality than in the fact you forgot to set your alarm, spent too much time watching Regis and Kelly and are now running late for work. Every drink is made one-at-a time which maximizes quality but not speediness. In fact, if you are ordering a latte or cappuccino, every drink will also include some latte art, even if you are slapping a lid on it. Also Crema''s muffins are insanely good and as a bonus they don''t have the paper wrapper around the bottom so you don''t have to peel it off. Let me tell you, this is reason enough to go there!

I do this because the crema is the soul of the espresso. Without it you are simply confronted with a dark and formless beverage that leaves you hovering over the face of some sort of liquid void.

The counter is no more than four paces from the front door and the menu is purposefully sparse—not only in it''s lack of fluff beverages but also in the fact that it is printed on the wall. It was immediately apparent the owner is a  purist. For instance, this is not the shop for suburban frappu-whatever drinkers. Crema offers only three flavors: mocha, vanilla and caramel. It''s the equivalent to restoring peace to the world by neutralizing one coffee-assassinating flavor at a time. However, other than the occasional mocha, I don''t flavor my coffee, therefore my Americano was ordered. The lever was pulled, the shots were extracted, and the drink slid across the counter to me. The liquid rocked easily back and forth in the ceramic with the thick crema surface holding together tightly reflecting deep, red-brown and golden swirls. It glistened with the oily coffee bean residue (crema is the only time ''oil'' and ''residue'' are good things as descriptors), hinting at the flavor that was to come. Butter, caramel, slight smokiness, crisp acidity and a subtly bitter, the deep body filled my taste buds and for the first time in a very long time, I savored every single ounce of that Americano. It''s at this point I should mention the espresso was a Novo roast. Sound familiar?

I do this because the crema is the soul of the espresso. Without it you are simply confronted with a dark and formless beverage that leaves you hovering over the face of some sort of liquid void. Crema contains the flavorful, complex, and oily soul of the espresso shot. It''s the lifeblood, and without the crema we wouldn''t know coffee like we do today. \r\n\r\nThat said, when Bot1 and I discovered an entire coffee shop named after this beauty, it was a no-brainer, or in Bot1''s case, and no-CPUer that we check it out. Everything this shop does, it does well. The website, branding, interior design and ultimately, the beverage are nothing of stellar. Bot1 is programmed to respond to excellence by demanding we go back again, and again, and again since it triggers an infinite loop. Right off the bat, I''d recommend you do the same. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As we entered Crema (nestled in the Five Points area, or NoDo) I was struck by the overall simplicity and itty-bitty-ness of the place. The counter is no more than four paces from the front door and the menu is purposefully sparse—not only in it''s lack of fluff beverages but also in the fact that it is printed on the wall. It was immediately apparent the owner is a  purist. For instance, this is not the shop for suburban frappu-whatever drinkers. Crema offers only three flavors: mocha, vanilla and caramel. It''s the equivalent to restoring peace to the world by neutralizing one coffee-assassinating flavor at a time. However, other than the occasional mocha, I don''t flavor my coffee, therefore my Americano was ordered. The lever was pulled, the shots were extracted, and the drink slid across the counter to me. The liquid rocked easily back and forth in the ceramic with the thick crema surface holding together tightly reflecting deep, red-brown and golden swirls. It glistened with the oily coffee bean residue (crema is the only time ''oil'' and ''residue'' are good things as descriptors), hinting at the flavor that was to come. Butter, caramel, slight smokiness, crisp acidity and a subtly bitter, the deep body filled my taste buds and for the first time in a very long time, I savored every single ounce of that Americano. It''s at this point I should mention the espresso was a Novo roast. Sound familiar? Other roasters who make an appearance at Crema are Herkimer and Pablo''s- according to the website, that is.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> is what it is. Clearly underground, it is cold, utilitarian, industrial and full of reclaimed odds and ends. The tables and chairs have that certain retro flair, and I''m pretty sure they are original stuff, not overpriced re-makes. Hip below-ground art adorned the brick/plaster walls when I first visited, and the room was quite bright thanks to a fairly large red-pained window in the front. I had a bit of trouble finding an outlet for my laptop and finally found one stuck around behind a couch, but I noticed plenty of people on their Macs not bothered by this lack who apparently have risen above the need for a plug. This is the sort of place you go to sip your velvety microfoam and discuss bands that don''t exist yet, not necessarily type up your doctoral thesis. There is a tiny bar that you can belly up to and watch the Baristas fashion their creations, and overall, considering the square footage, there is a good amount of seating for the size.\r\n\r\nFinally, a few points to note: First, you don''t go there if you are in a rush. It''s obvious the owner is more interested in the beverage quality than in the fact you forgot to set your alarm, spent too much time watching Regis and Kelly and are now running late for work. Every drink is made one-at-a time which maximizes quality but not speediness. In fact, if you are ordering a latte or cappuccino, every drink will also include some latte art, even if you are slapping a lid on it. Also Crema''s muffins are insanely good and as a bonus they don''t have the paper wrapper around the bottom so you don''t have to peel it off. Let me tell you, this is reason enough to go there!

The counter is no more than four paces from the front door and the menu is purposefully sparse—not only in it''s lack of fluff beverages but also in the fact that it is printed on the wall. It was immediately apparent the owner is a purist. For instance, this is not the shop for suburban frappu-whatever drinkers. Crema offers only three flavors: mocha, vanilla and caramel. It''s the equivalent to restoring peace to the world by neutralizing one coffee-assassinating flavor at a time. However, other than the occasional mocha, I don''t flavor my coffee, therefore my Americano was ordered. The lever was pulled, the shots were extracted, and the drink slid across the counter to me. The liquid rocked easily back and forth in the ceramic with the thick crema surface holding together tightly reflecting deep, red-brown and golden swirls. It glistened with the oily coffee bean residue (crema is the only time ''oil'' and ''residue'' are good things as descriptors), hinting at the flavor that was to come. Butter, caramel, crisp acidity and subtly bitterness filled my taste buds and for the first time in a very long time, I savored every single ounce of that Americano. (It''s at this point I should mention the espresso was a Novo roast. Sound familiar? Other roasters who make an appearance at Crema are Herkimer and Pablo''s- according to the website, that is.)\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> is what it is. Clearly underground, it is cold, utilitarian and industrial with a few reclaimed odds and ends. The tables and chairs have that certain retro flair, and I''m pretty sure they are original stuff, not overpriced re-makes. Hip below-ground art adorned the brick/plaster walls when I first visited, and the room was quite bright thanks to a fairly large red-pained window in the front. I had a bit of trouble finding an outlet for my laptop and finally found one stuck around behind a couch, but I noticed plenty of people on their Macs not bothered by this lack who apparently have risen above the need for a plug. Who needs an outlet, though? This is the sort of place you go to sip your velvety microfoam and discuss bands that don''t exist yet, not necessarily type up your doctoral thesis. There is a tiny bar that you can belly up to and watch the Baristas fashion their creations, and overall, considering the square footage, there is a good amount of seating for the size.\r\n\r\nFinally, a few points to note: First, you don''t go there if you are in a rush. It''s obvious the owner is more interested in the beverage quality than in the fact you forgot to set your alarm, spent too much time watching The Kardashians reruns and are now running late for work. Every drink is made one-at-a time which maximizes quality but not speediness. In fact, if you are ordering a latte or cappuccino, each will include some sort of latte design, even if you are slapping a lid on it. Second, Crema''s muffins are insanely good and as a bonus they don''t have the paper wrapper around the bottom so you don''t have to peel it off. Let me tell you, this is reason enough to go there!

I do this because the crema is the soul of the espresso. Without it you are simply confronted with a dark and formless beverage that leaves you hovering over the face of some sort of liquid void. Crema contains the flavorful, complex, and oily soul of the espresso shot.

Right off the bat, I''d recommend you do the same. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As we entered Crema (nestled in the Five Points area, or NoDo) I was struck by the overall simplicity and itty-bitty-ness of the place. The counter is no more than four paces from the front door and the menu is purposefully sparse—not only in it''s lack of fluff beverages but also in the fact that it is printed on the wall. It was immediately apparent the owner is a purist. For instance, this is not the shop for suburban frappu-whatever drinkers. Crema offers only three flavors: mocha, vanilla and caramel. It''s the equivalent to restoring peace to the world by neutralizing one coffee-assassinating flavor at a time. However, other than the occasional mocha, I don''t flavor my coffee, therefore my Americano was ordered. The lever was pulled, the shots were extracted, and the drink slid across the counter to me. The liquid rocked easily back and forth in the ceramic with the thick crema surface holding together tightly reflecting deep, red-brown and golden swirls. It glistened with the oily coffee bean residue (crema is the only time ''oil'' and ''residue'' are good things as descriptors), hinting at the flavor that was to come. Butter, caramel, crisp acidity and subtly bitterness filled my taste buds and for the first time in a very long time, I savored every single ounce of that Americano. (It''s at this point I should mention the espresso was a Novo roast. Sound familiar? Other roasters who make an appearance at Crema are Herkimer and Pablo''s- according to the website, that is.)\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> is what it is. Clearly underground, it is cold, utilitarian and industrial with a few reclaimed odds and ends. The tables and chairs have that certain retro flair, and I''m pretty sure they are original stuff, not overpriced re-makes. Hip below-ground art adorned the brick/plaster walls when I first visited, and the room was quite bright thanks to a fairly large red-pained window in the front. I had a bit of trouble finding an outlet for my laptop and finally found one stuck around behind a couch, but I noticed plenty of people on their Macs not bothered by this lack who apparently have risen above the need for a plug. Who needs an outlet, though? This is the sort of place you go to sip your velvety microfoam and discuss bands that don''t exist yet, not necessarily type up your doctoral thesis. There is a tiny bar that you can belly up to and watch the Baristas fashion their creations, and overall, considering the square footage, there is a good amount of seating for the size.\r\n\r\nFinally, a few points to note: First, you don''t go there if you are in a rush. It''s obvious the owner is more interested in the beverage quality than in the fact you forgot to set your alarm, spent too much time watching The Kardashians reruns and are now running late for work. Every drink is made one-at-a time which maximizes quality but not speediness. In fact, if you are ordering a latte or cappuccino, each will include some sort of latte design, even if you are slapping a lid on it. Second, Crema''s muffins are insanely good and as a bonus they don''t have the paper wrapper around the bottom so you don''t have to peel it off. Let me tell you, this is reason enough to go there! Finally, they have a great selection of fine teas, but that review is up to TeaBot, not me, and TeaBot doesn''t even exist...yet.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> In conclusion: go there.

I do this because the crema is the soul of the espresso. Without it you are simply confronted with a dark and formless beverage that leaves you hovering over the face of some sort of liquid void. Crema contains the flavorful, complex, and oily soul of the espresso shot.

Right off the bat, I''d recommend you do the same. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As we entered Crema (nestled in the Five Points area, or NoDo) I was struck by the overall simplicity and itty-bitty-ness of the place. The counter is no more than four paces from the front door and the menu is purposefully sparse—not only in its lack of fluff beverages but also in the fact that it is printed on the wall. It was immediately apparent the owner is a purist. For instance, this is not the shop for suburban frappu-whatever drinkers. Crema offers only three flavors: mocha, vanilla and caramel. It''s the equivalent to restoring peace to the world by neutralizing one coffee-assassinating flavor at a time. However, other than the occasional mocha, I don''t flavor my coffee, therefore my Americano was ordered. The lever was pulled, the shots were extracted, and the drink slid across the counter to me. The liquid rocked easily back and forth in the ceramic with the thick crema surface holding together tightly reflecting deep, red-brown and golden swirls. It glistened with the oily coffee bean residue (crema is the only time ''oil'' and ''residue'' are good things as descriptors), hinting at the flavor that was to come. Butter, caramel, crisp acidity and subtle bitterness filled my taste buds and for the first time in a very long time, I savored every single ounce of that Americano. (It''s at this point I should mention the espresso was a Novo roast. Sound familiar? Other roasters who make an appearance at Crema are Herkimer and Pablo''s- according to the website, that is.)\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> is what it is. Clearly underground, it is cold, utilitarian and industrial with a few reclaimed odds and ends. The tables and chairs have that certain retro flair, and I''m pretty sure they are original stuff, not overpriced re-makes. Hip below-ground art adorned the brick/plaster walls when I first visited, and the room was quite bright thanks to a fairly large red-pained window in the front. I had a bit of trouble finding an outlet for my laptop and finally found one stuck around behind a couch, but I noticed plenty of people on their Macs not bothered by this lack who apparently have risen above the need for a plug. Who needs an outlet, though? This is the sort of place you go to sip your velvety microfoam and discuss bands that don''t exist yet, not necessarily type up your doctoral thesis. There is a tiny bar that you can belly up to and watch the Baristas fashion their creations, and overall, considering the square footage, there is a good amount of seating for the size.\r\n\r\nFinally, a few points to note: First, you don''t go there if you are in a rush. It''s obvious the owner is more interested in the beverage quality than in the fact you forgot to set your alarm, spent too much time watching Kardashians reruns and are now running late for work. Every drink is made one-at-a time which maximizes quality but not speediness. In fact, if you are ordering a latte or cappuccino, each will include some sort of latte design, even if you are slapping a lid on it. Second, Crema''s muffins are insanely good and as a bonus they don''t have the paper wrapper around the bottom so you don''t have to peel it off. Let me tell you, this is reason enough to go there! Finally, they have a great selection of fine teas, but that review is up to TeaBot, not me, and TeaBot doesn''t even exist...yet.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> In conclusion: go there.

I do this because the crema is the soul of the espresso. Without it you are simply confronted with a dark and formless beverage that leaves you hovering over the face of some sort of liquid void. Crema contains the flavorful, complex, and oily soul of the espresso shot. It''s the lifeblood and excitement of coffee itself. \r\n\r\nThat said, when Bot1 discovered an entire coffee shop named after this beauty, it was a no-brainer, or in Bot1''s case, a no-CPUer that we check it out.

The counter is no more than four paces from the front door and the menu is purposefully sparse—not only in its lack of fluff beverages but also in the fact that it is printed on the wall. It was immediately apparent the owner is a purist. For instance, this is not the shop for suburban frappu-whatever drinkers. Crema offers only three flavors: mocha, vanilla and caramel. It''s the equivalent to restoring peace to the world by neutralizing one coffee-assassinating flavor at a time. However, other than the occasional mocha, I don''t flavor my coffee, therefore my Americano was ordered. The lever was pulled, the shots were extracted, and the drink slid across the counter to me. The liquid rocked easily back and forth in the ceramic with the thick crema surface holding together tightly reflecting deep, red-brown and golden swirls. It glistened with the oily coffee bean residue (crema is the only time ''oil'' and ''residue'' are good things as descriptors), hinting at the flavor that was to come. Butter, caramel, crisp acidity and subtle bitterness filled my taste buds and for the first time in a very long time, I savored every single ounce of that Americano. (It''s at this point I should mention the espresso was a Novo roast. Sound familiar? Other roasters who make an appearance at Crema are Herkimer and Pablo''s- according to the website, that is.)\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> is what it is. Clearly underground, it is cold, utilitarian and industrial with a few reclaimed odds and ends. The tables and chairs have that certain retro flair, and I''m pretty sure they are original stuff, not overpriced re-makes. Hip below-ground art adorned the brick/plaster walls when I first visited, and the room was quite bright thanks to a fairly large red-pained window in the front. I had a bit of trouble finding an outlet for my laptop and finally found one stuck around behind a couch, but I noticed plenty of people on their Macs not bothered by this lack who apparently have risen above the need for a plug. Who needs an outlet, though? This is the sort of place you go to sip your velvety microfoam and discuss bands that don''t exist yet, not necessarily type up your doctoral thesis. There is a tiny bar that you can belly up to and watch the Baristas fashion their creations, and overall, considering the square footage, there is a good amount of seating for the size.\r\n\r\nFinally, a few points to note: First, you don''t go there if you are in a rush. It''s obvious the owner is more interested in the beverage quality than in the fact you forgot to set your alarm, spent too much time watching Kardashians reruns and are now running late for work. Every drink is made one-at-a time which maximizes quality but not speediness. In fact, if you are ordering a latte or cappuccino, each will include some sort of latte design, even if you are slapping a lid on it. Second, Crema''s muffins are insanely good and as a bonus they don''t have the paper wrapper around the bottom so you don''t have to peel it off. Let me tell you, this is reason enough to go there! Finally, they have a great selection of fine teas, but that review is up to TeaBot, not me, and TeaBot doesn''t even exist...yet.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> In conclusion: go there.

I do this because the crema is the soul of the espresso. Without it you are simply confronted with a dark and formless beverage that leaves you hovering over the face of some sort of liquid void. Crema contains the flavorful, complex, and oily soul of the espresso shot. It''s the lifeblood and excitement of coffee itself. \n\nThat said, when Bot1 discovered an entire coffee shop named after this beauty, it was a no-brainer, or in Bot1''s case, a no-CPUer that we check it out. Everything this shop does, it does well. The website, branding, interior design and ultimately, the coffee are nothing short of stellar. Bot1 is programmed to respond to excellence by demanding we go back again, and again, and again since it triggers an infinite system loop. Right off the bat, I''d recommend you do the same. \n\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As we entered Crema (nestled in the Five Points area, or NoDo) I was struck by the overall simplicity and itty-bitty-ness of the place. The counter is no more than four paces from the front door and the menu is purposefully sparse—not only in its lack of fluff beverages but also in the fact that it is printed on the wall. It was immediately apparent the owner is a purist. For instance, this is not the shop for suburban frappu-whatever drinkers. Crema offers only three flavors: mocha, vanilla and caramel. It''s the equivalent to restoring peace to the world by neutralizing one coffee-assassinating flavor at a time. However, other than the occasional mocha, I don''t flavor my coffee, therefore my Americano was ordered. The lever was pulled, the shots were extracted, and the drink slid across the counter to me. The liquid rocked easily back and forth in the ceramic with the thick crema surface holding together tightly reflecting deep, red-brown and golden swirls. It glistened with the oily coffee bean residue (crema is the only time ''oil'' and ''residue'' are good things as descriptors), hinting at the flavor that was to come. Butter, caramel, crisp acidity and subtle bitterness filled my taste buds and for the first time in a very long time, I savored every single ounce of that Americano. (It''s at this point I should mention the espresso was a Novo roast. Sound familiar? Other roasters who make an appearance at Crema are Herkimer and Pablo''s- according to the website, that is.)\n\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> is what it is. Clearly underground, it is cold, utilitarian and industrial with a few reclaimed odds and ends. The tables and chairs have that certain retro flair, and I''m pretty sure they are original stuff, not overpriced re-makes. Hip below-ground art adorned the brick/plaster walls when I first visited, and the room was quite bright thanks to a fairly large red-pained window in the front. I had a bit of trouble finding an outlet for my laptop and finally found one behind a couch, but I noticed plenty of people on their Macs not bothered by this who apparently have risen above the need for a plug. Who needs an outlet, though? This is the sort of place you go to sip your velvety microfoam and discuss bands that don''t exist yet, not necessarily type up your doctoral thesis. There is a tiny bar that you can belly up to and watch the Baristas fashion their creations, and overall, considering the square footage, there is a good amount of seating for the size.\n\nFinally, a few points to note: First, you don''t go there if you are in a rush. It''s obvious the owner is more interested in the beverage quality than in the fact you forgot to set your alarm, spent too much time watching Kardashians reruns and are now running late for work. Every drink is made one-at-a time which maximizes quality but not speediness. In fact, if you are ordering a latte or cappuccino, each will include some sort of latte design, even if you are slapping a lid on it. Second, Crema''s muffins are insanely good and as a bonus they don''t have the paper wrapper around the bottom so you don''t have to peel it off. Let me tell you, this is reason enough to go there! Finally, they have a great selection of fine teas, but that review is up to TeaBot, not me, and TeaBot doesn''t even exist...yet.\n\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> In conclusion: go there. No excuses, just go. You won''t regret it. \n[mappress mapid="10"]\n<hr />\n<p style="text-align: center">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>\n<h2>Have you been to Crema?

I do this because the crema is the soul of the espresso. Without it you are simply confronted with a dark and formless beverage that leaves you hovering over the face of some sort of liquid void. Crema contains the flavorful, complex, and oily soul of the espresso shot. It''s the lifeblood and excitement of coffee itself. \r\n\r\nThat said, when Bot1 discovered an entire coffee shop named after this beauty, it was a no-brainer, or in Bot1''s case, a no-CPUer that we check it out. Everything this shop does, it does well. The website, branding, interior design and ultimately, the coffee are nothing short of stellar. Bot1 is programmed to respond to excellence by demanding we go back again, and again, and again since it triggers an infinite system loop. Right off the bat, I''d recommend you do the same. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As we entered Crema (nestled in the Five Points area, or NoDo) I was struck by the overall simplicity and itty-bitty-ness of the place. The counter is no more than four paces from the front door and the menu is purposefully sparse—not only in its lack of fluff beverages but also in the fact that it is printed on the wall. It was immediately apparent the owner is a purist. For instance, this is not the shop for suburban frappu-whatever drinkers. Crema offers only three flavors: mocha, vanilla and caramel. It''s the equivalent to restoring peace to the world by neutralizing one coffee-assassinating flavor at a time. However, other than the occasional mocha, I don''t flavor my coffee, therefore my Americano was ordered. The lever was pulled, the shots were extracted, and the drink slid across the counter to me. The liquid rocked easily back and forth in the ceramic with the thick crema surface holding together tightly reflecting deep, red-brown and golden swirls. It glistened with the oily coffee bean residue (crema is the only time ''oil'' and ''residue'' are good things as descriptors), hinting at the flavor that was to come. Butter, caramel, crisp acidity and subtle bitterness filled my taste buds and for the first time in a very long time, I savored every single ounce of that Americano. (It''s at this point I should mention the espresso was a Novo roast. Sound familiar? Other roasters who make an appearance at Crema are Herkimer and Pablo''s- according to the website, that is.)\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> is what it is. Clearly underground, it is cold, utilitarian and industrial with a few reclaimed odds and ends. The tables and chairs have that certain retro flair, and I''m pretty sure they are original stuff, not overpriced re-makes. Hip below-ground art adorned the brick/plaster walls when I first visited, and the room was quite bright thanks to a fairly large red-pained window in the front. I had a bit of trouble finding an outlet for my laptop and finally found one behind a couch, but I noticed plenty of people on their Macs not bothered by this who apparently have risen above the need for a plug. Who needs an outlet, though? This is the sort of place you go to sip your velvety microfoam and discuss bands that don''t exist yet, not necessarily type up your doctoral thesis. There is a tiny bar that you can belly up to and watch the Baristas fashion their creations, and overall, considering the square footage, there is a good amount of seating for the size.\r\n\r\nFinally, a few points to note: First, you don''t go there if you are in a rush. It''s obvious the owner is more interested in the beverage quality than in the fact you forgot to set your alarm, spent too much time watching Kardashians reruns and are now running late for work. Every drink is made one-at-a time which maximizes quality but not speediness. In fact, if you are ordering a latte or cappuccino, each will include some sort of latte design, even if you are slapping a lid on it. Second, Crema''s muffins are insanely good and as a bonus they don''t have the paper wrapper around the bottom so you don''t have to peel it off. Let me tell you, this is reason enough to go there! Finally, they have a great selection of fine teas, but that review is up to TeaBot, not me, and TeaBot doesn''t even exist...yet.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> In conclusion: go there. No excuses, just go. You won''t regret it. \r\n[mappress mapid="10"]\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: center">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>\r\n<h2>Have you been to Crema?

On first impression, this shop appears tidy, but worn and outdated—rather like your kitschy great-aunt’s 80s-tastic pastel dining room. The marble and cast-iron tables, though, are wonderfully stable for writing, playing chess, etc. (I scoff at Bot2’s affinity for wobbly furniture). The place was almost awkwardly quiet, but we were glad that there were only a handful of other early afternoon customers because the single barista, though rather adept at latte art, operated the manual espresso machine fairly slowly. In dealing with customers—including our delightful selves and some who were more than a little obnoxious—she upheld La Dolce Vita’s claim of being “Arvada’s friendliest coffeehouse,” without seeming overly pushy or fake.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> La Dolce Vita offers a pretty extensive selection of teas, espresso, and syrup flavors, as well as breakfast items and pastries, but I settled on a small americano (12oz. = $2.20). The espresso was very mild and smooth—perfectly adequate for a quick boost after shopping, though not a lot to savor. This shop does run specials (e.g. $1.75 lattes after 2pm) and provides a loyalty card to allow regulars to earn a free drink, which is always a plus in my rather sparse pocketbook.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere. </span>There were plenty of tables inside (and a handful on the sidewalk outside), so we choose a semi-private spot in the bay window. The general lack of outlets in this area seemed to distress Bot1 on principle, but I appreciated that the laptop creeper who wanted to share our table had to sit across the room (I imagine he couldn’t help gravitating toward bots, though I’ve resolved to practice looking unsavory).\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> If you go, a note of warning: there is a step from the café seating area down to the counter. For some reason, the glaring yellow signs warning me to watch my step proved difficult to read while I was falling on my face.

We found ourselves at Folsom St. Coffee Co. This is a college joint through and through, and the day we visited it was its usual self: packed, hip...and green. According to their website, Folsom St. Coffee is “Boulder''s only true eco-friendly coffeehouse. Folsom St. Coffee Co. was awarded the Eco-Cycle award for ''Zero Waste or Darn Near'' as well as the "Waste Reduction" award from the Center For Resource Conservation.” I believe it, because when Bot1 tried to throw away his trash, his waste eliminating algorithm caused his CPU to overheat just trying to sort out which tub to throw what in.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As has become customary, a double espresso was ordered and Bot1 left to talk up a couple students who were sitting outside. The espresso presented to me had a deceivingly beautiful thick crema that held fast when I spooned some sugar on top. That was a good sign. The flavor, however, was a disappointment. Oddly enough I felt like I was drinking a lime. Of course there were most of the typical espresso qualities, but the acidity was shocking! I''d like to attribute this to the extraction of the shot, but I watched it pour and everything was on the up and up. The flavor evened out when it was in an Americano, but overall I wasn''t too impressed with the flavor.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span>Like many coffee shops, however, the experience doesn''t always center around the coffee, and ultimately Folsom St. Coffee delivered in other areas. The atmosphere was welcoming, cozy and was the sort of place in which I felt I could get motivated to finally write my 20 page single-spaced essay on the relationship between Pyongyang and Beijing. The muddled and haphazard decor actually cemented the cozy feeling, and that constant murmur of a packed coffee house was ideal for working, meeting friends, or simply sipping a cup of coffee.

A little bored, Bot1 insisted we consult my very-cute-coffee-name-pun list</span> to see if something piqued our interest, and it was then we decided on Common Grounds Coffee House. <a href="http://coffeebot.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/deathbeam.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-308" title="deathbeam" src="http://coffeebot.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/deathbeam.jpg" alt="deathbeam" width="250" height="188" /></a>While usually passionate about the coffee (passion being one of Bot1''s few emulated emotions), Bot1 was more interested in reading “Death Beam”, a title he''d spotted on the bookshelf, and while I always try to discourage him reading anything with “death” in it, I decided to pick my battle and allow it. Bot1 then marched up to the counter, emitted his demand for a whole milk latte and a double espresso, beamed the book off the shelf, and proceeded to process the pages via his OCR scanner.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As usual, I was left with the coffee. The person who made the drinks was extremely friendly (bonus) and after a pleasant interaction about the weather she proceeded to focus in on the latte. I noticed she took much care when steaming the milk and while I couldn''t see the shots as they were extracted, the aroma was enticing and the shots were swiftly combined with the milk. I was given the latte which embodied thick, dense foam, slight hints of brown espresso swirled through the mix, and a warmth that was comforting on that chilly day. Ultimately, however, the flavor, while it didn''t disappoint, was only average. To be certain, it was a good latte—one I would return for—but  once again the reality was that to have truly impressive beverages, the coffee itself must be spectacular, and it just wasn''t. The double espresso disappointed slightly as well. The crema was thin and nearly immediately broke to reveal the dark body of the shot. The“raining” effect or separation of the shot was reminiscent of Guinness, which, as luck would have it, is served at Common Grounds as well. The flavor didn''t go deep enough either. The initial stark bitterness never really left my tongue and the acidity was slightly overwhelming, so much so that any dimension that might have been there was masked by this intensity.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span> Common Grounds embodied a balanced mix of the old and new. The counter and bar were your typical curvy-bistro-coolness with lots of angles thrown in that made for exciting visuals. There was plenty of room to sprawl out on one of their two very large tables, or keep to yourself on any one of their abundant four-seaters. One feature Bot1 and I liked a lot was the presence of bookshelves with actual physical books. On top of that, if one so desired, one could pick up and read...one. During my visit I did notice a young guy in skinny pants with his Mac under his arm stroking his chin in silent wonder at the spectacle of these books, but for the most part people knew what to do with them. Large windows overlooking the busy street allowed generous amounts of light in, illuminating the local art canvases aiding in a vibrant feel; and the constant murmur of machines, music, and conversation were all at the perfect level.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> Common Grounds Coffee House withstands the test. Sure, I wasn''t bowled over by the coffee, but in the end it was <em>good</em>. Combined with the atmosphere and friendliness of the employees, it''s definitely a place you should check out. Bot1 agrees and also informed me “Death Beam” didn''t live up to his planet domination aspirations...much to my relief.<span class="end-icon">END</span>\r\n\r\n[mappress mapid="4"]<!--more-->', 'Common Grounds Coffee House', '<a href="http://coffeebot.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/common-grounds.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-286" title="common-grounds" src="http://coffeebot.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/common-grounds.jpg" alt="common grounds coffee house" width="528" height="200" /></a>\r\nIt was a quiet day.

It''s a great place being not only a coffee shop, but also a cafe and bar.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee</span> Bot1 showed up in a pair of skinny jeans he had purchased from the Salvation Army, and after I wrestled them off of him, he sulked up to the counter and ordered a small latte. Even though we ordered a small, it came in a nice big mug, and after some detailed chemical analysis, Bot1 concluded the cinnamon on top of the foam was in fact, cinnamon. A nice touch, but if you don''t like people putting spices on your coffee, you might mention that upon ordering. After this, he lost interest, went over to the bar, and I was left to do the tasting by myself.\r\n\r\nThe latte was...good; nothing amazing. The foam was a tad bubbly and I would have liked more espresso presence, but the flavor that was there was smooth and balanced, so I can''t really complain. This isn''t an artisan place, so I didn''t detect much passion for coffee itself; I understand that coffee passion isn''t necessarily the point to the place.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> The main thing about this joint is that you can come in, set up your lappy, and do what you do best: hit up Facebook. Keep in mind that most people who sit there for a while are also on their laptops, so the connection speed is pretty slow. So, if you''re heading there to play Warcraft, it might not be the best place. Then again, you probably wouldn''t actually head outside to go to a coffee shop, either.\r\n\r\nAnother great aspect is the presence of living, breathing people (not just spoiled robots), and at this place, the flow of humans is pretty constant. Of all the times I have visited, I''ve never seen it empty, and I like that. The steady murmur of conversation is the perfect soundtrack to get my work done. It definitely is a neighborhood staple, and you aren''t without choices on where to sit or plug in. There''s plenty of room in the coffee side, bar side, and there''s even a little patio outback where cigarettes tend to be smoked.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> Overall, it''s a good place, and I find myself recommending it often.

That said, it was hot, and I needed something cool.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee</span> The person working there, who I later found out was the owner, convinced me to try what he called a "toddy", or a cold brewed coffee. I say convinced, because I am a pretty staunch hot coffee kind of guy. Bot1 couldn''t compute the concept of cold coffee, and already being overheated from the 90 degree outside temps, inadvertently went into hibernate mode before his processor overheated. However, I accepted. The cold brew turned out to be exactly what I needed on that hot day. Unlike other iced coffees that I''ve had which usually capitalize on overwhelmingly acidic, citrus notes to fool you in to thinking you''re being refreshed, there was a general lack of acidity which was replaced with a surprisingly deep, smooth palette of caramel and earth tones. Not at all what I expected from a cold coffee. A hint of spice lingered on my tongue and the aftertaste, despite the overall intensity, was very pleasant. The flavor lasted, as well, and despite being slightly watered down from the ice, my last sip was just as good as the first. I was sold.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span>As for the other important aspects to the shop: service and atmosphere, there are a few more notes to ad. Since I was served by the owner, I was immediately engaged in pleasant conversation and was able to talk for a fair amount of time about coffee, asking questions, etc., and he was more than willing to chat. I get the vibe that it''s an atmosphere he tries to foster. And, speaking of atmosphere, well, you don''t go there for it. The tables were uncomfortable, especially for the lengthy amount of time I was there (waiting on Bot1 to wake up), the blue walls made me nervous, and the local art display, while well-intentioned, was haphazard and not well organized.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span><span style="color: #999999;"><em>(A note here: this original review was written back in July and I have since seen they are doing some work on the place, so the atmosphere complaint might be a moot point)</em></span> None of that would keep me from there, however, because this is the kind of coffee shop you go to for the superb coffee, you don''t have to go there for anything else.

I know, I know, a suburban coffee shop, but bear with me...<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The History</span> From what I know about this place, its pedigree is traced back to Tacoma, Washington—not a bad place to come from, I suppose. Their self-description talks of being a vital part of the community and being inspired by Italy''s espresso culture, yada yada yada. Nearly everyone says that. Even Howard Schultz said that at one time and look where that got us. However, their expressed desire to be a neighborhood coffee shop seems to actually be working.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee</span> My standard first-time drink is usually an Americano or latte. In this case, the Americano is a wonderful baseline drink. If made correctly, you get a lovely crema, the hot water and espresso combination even out the flavor of the coffee, and let''s face it: espresso is gone way too fast. I''m not Italian, for Pete''s sake. I love espresso shots but will only drink it straight in places I really trust. To my delight, I heard the familiar banging of portafilters into bins, and I had a feeling I was in for a treat. The drink was produced and brought to my table, whereupon I viewed that  nice layer of crema. The flavor was good. Not amazing, but good. The espresso certainly embodied everything a fine espresso should: full body, slight bitterness, subtle caramel tones; but for me, the dimension didn''t go far enough. That''s hardly a negative, since the intensity of espresso is, after all, subjective.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> For once, this is a suburban coffee shop that is actually comfortable and has a hint of urban dinge that in my opinion, all the best coffee shops have. Sometimes, the dingier the better. The deep yellow-gold, black, copper and dark wood mix well to form a comfortable and inspiring atmosphere. Armed with a great comfy-couch area and plenty of tables (including outside seating) you definitely have your choice of places to sit. Mine, however, was by the fireplace. And that''s enough about the design, I drink coffee, after all.\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> Finally, the experience was punctuated by genuinely nice staff. I''ve been a few times, and even Bot1 has sneaked over there a couple times when I haven''t been looking. Witty small talk and a staff that calls  you by name on the second visit is a good step in the direction of having a lasting neighborhood coffee shop.<span class="end-icon">END</span>\r\n[mappress mapid="3"]\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>', 'Forza Coffee', 'I was trying to decide which coffee house to review first for Coffee-Bot.

True to the culture of the area, all the coffee served and roasted is fair trade and organic, caters to hippies and yuppies alike, has a very friendly staff, and owns its fair share of potted plants. Paul''s is definitely a place worth stopping in, and the added incentive for me is the fact they roast their own coffee. The roaster, positioned [strategically] close to the front door, greets you with the smokey-sweet aroma of roasted beans, an aroma that you hit like a wall upon entrance. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> True to form, a double espresso was ordered and Bot1 set to processing the menu''s unique price points (2.77 for a latte, for instance). At the first sip I was happy to taste a wonderfully balanced extraction with slight berry notes and a clean acidity. Translated, it was good. Bot1, who''d ordered a Mocha, let me share a bit of his which was also very good. He quickly snatched it back, however, since whipped cream offers one of the few excitements he gets to experience in his emulated life. This means the espresso holds its own <em>on</em> its own, or as the foundation to the assortment of espresso-based drinks. \r\n<a href="http://coffeebot.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/pauls-2.jpg"><img src="http://coffeebot.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/pauls-2.jpg" alt="Paul&#039;s Atmosphere" title="pauls-2" width="525" height="199" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-529" /></a>\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span> The atmosphere draws you in with its simplicity folky charm. The entire east, north, and west walls are actually windows which offer peeks toward the Flatirons and rich sunlight that''s very warm in the winter but slightly too warm in the summer. The folk theme carries through with bluegrass instruments, country nick knacks, decrepit windows as wall art, and even a moonshine jug that Bot1 was entirely convinced was full of moonshine. It''s the sort of place you''d expect to find tucked back in the pines of the Rockies. Local art rotates fairly often and is always a good variety. There is a decent amount of tables and chairs and along the windows are a few power strips to plug your lifestyle in to. Be prepared to share a table with someone if you absolutely need an outlet though, since there isn''t a huge selection of tables along the windows. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> With daily specials, customer loyalty punch cards, coffee by the press, happy hour, decent prices (even if they are a bit odd), perks if you donate to a charity and Saturday Bluegrass concerts, Paul''s definitely gives you plenty of reasons to return and get in touch with your country-coffee side. <span class="end-icon">END</span>\r\n[mappress mapid="11"]\r\n<br />\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>\r\n<h2>Have you been to Paul''s Coffee & Tea?

This is a place I had to visit. “Redefine(ing)” can be dangerous. Bot1 once tried to redefine rock. That''s how the world got prog-rock. Hopefully the coffee shop ''redefinement'' turns out a bit better. Bot1 was also excited to visit since there were computers he could use instead of relying on his 28k on-board modem to download 25 minute drum solos. So, we headed for the shop and arrived barely out of the shadows of downtown''s skyscrapers in an uncomfortably sterile neighborhood of condos and street shops.\r\n\r\nMy first impression of the place was positive and not at all what I expected after checking the shop''s website (which doesn''t do the place any justice). It was packed with city peeps when we arrived and I wound my way through tables and urbanites to the counter where I was welcomed by a large overhead menu and a not so welcoming, too-cool-for-school barista. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee. </span>I ordered a double espresso ($1.80) and Bot1 went for the mocha (medium:$3.50). The espresso was presented in a demitasse and I couldn''t wait to have my first sip. Once again, I stumbled on a place serving Novo coffee and was eager to see how it emerged from the machine. The first sip flashed with a bright acidity that yielded a complex cluster of flavors reminding me a bit of peanut butter—I was happy. It wasn''t the best espresso I''ve had but as the foundation to the rest of the beverages it was quality nonetheless. The mocha was fairly good as well (I sneaked a sip while Bot1 configured his IP address) although it was a bit sweet. It''s also worth noting that this truly is a good place for the coffee aficionado since I saw numerous french presses and am pretty sure some pourover coffee magic. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere. </span>What really makes Fluid Coffee tick is what I mentioned in the beginning of this post: coffee shop ''redefinement-ation-ing''. There is an abundance of places to sit, relax, work, and plug in. This is no internet cafe of the old days when shifty old guys hovered over bulky computers that were crammed against the walls of dingy, fluorescent-lit rooms sipping over-extracted, stale coffee. Instead you have flat panels, windows (so you''re not completely cut off from the world), shifty lawyers instead of shifty old guys, and superb coffee. Okay, I concede a bit of redefining. Fluid coffee has filled every nook with something for the customer: books, magazines, art, computers, and a [new] room full of tables that you can reserve for yourself or your team. You also don''t have to be without those office amenities if you are working remotely. For a fee, you are able to print and copy your top secret documents or the next great American novel. There is even a large column right next to the counter plastered with adverts and business cards so you can get ye-self out there and get discovered. Finally, I found the atmosphere fairly inspirational: multicolored walls, comfortable seating, clutter, conversational murmur, and a diversity of patrons did well to get the juices flowing. It''s the sort of place Bot1 and I can fit in with no brow-raising—it''s truly a neighborhood coffee shop. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End. </span>So, does it redefine the coffee shop experience? They certainly make it easy for the incognito professional to have place to work, serve outstanding coffee, and manage to do all this without being a creepy internet cafe. Fluid coffee has found a great mix of community, casual, and professional. At the same time, it''s still only a coffee shop: one that neither wowed or excited me, but one that I most definitely will recommend to others and visit again...and again. <span class="end-icon-bot2">END</span>\r\n[mappress mapid="13"]\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>\r\n', 'Fluid Coffee Bar', '<a href="http://coffeebot.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/fluid.jpg"><img src="http://coffeebot.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/fluid.jpg" alt="fluid coffee bar" title="fluid coffee bar" width="525" height="199" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-592" /></a>\r\n\r\nA friend mentioned a place in uptown Denver that was attempting to re-define the coffee shop experience.</span> “Redefine, eh?”.

This is especially the case for the majority of brewed coffee drinkers out there. Preparing excellent coffee at home is not really that hard; it''s also not really that time consuming. With the right tools and the right ingredients you can rival anything you find in a coffee shop. Look, If you are completely okay with coffee that comes from a plastic tub or out of the machine at 7-11, this post probably won''t mean much to you. If, however, you want that quality cup but don''t want to spend the $2 every day, or you want to impress your guests with killer coffee and dessert, this just might help you out. The rest of this post assumes you are striving for excellence every time you make coffee in your casa.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Tools...</span>\r\nFor every project, you have to have the right tools to get the job done well. For this post, we''ll be making coffee via French press, so, here''s what you''ll need:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>French press</li>\r\n	<li>grinder: blade or burr</li>\r\n	<li>kettle</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span class="first-words">The Ingredients...</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>whole bean coffee</li>\r\n	<li>filtered water</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Water is Key!</span>\r\nFirst off, your coffee is only as good as your water! The number one important element of good coffee is water! Think about it: coffee is 98% H2O, so if your water tastes bad, chances are your coffee will as well even if you are using $50/lb coffee. You don''t have to have an expensive reverse osmosis system to achieve good water; a simple water filtering pitcher, or even bottled drinking water will do the trick.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span>\r\nOkay, for (good) coffee beans, I recommend you pop down to your local coffee shop and purchase a half or full pound of beans. Don''t know what to get? Just ask, they are usually more than willing to chat and help you pick a roast. Shops often sell what they serve, so if there is a particular brew you really enjoy, grab a pound of that. It is also possible to find good beans in the grocery store, but it''s a little harder and you don''t really know if it''s good or not until you try it. Here''s a tip: in my experience, anything labeled with the generic descriptor “gourmet”  is a complete flop and I would avoid it like the plague. The same goes when I visit a restaurants and cafes. Most self-respecting roasters and coffee shops no longer use this term.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Grind Your Coffee As You Go </span>\r\nThis may seem like quite a burden each time you make coffee, but here''s why you want to grind as you go: once coffee has been roasted, oxygen becomes its mortal enemy and immediately the flavors in the oils begin to evaporate and the bean begins to sour. This is why coffee beans arrive in air-tight packages protected from all that nasty oxygen. Furthermore, when you grind coffee, you compromise the flavor''s ''housing'' and add more surface area for the beans to spoil, giving the ground coffee a very, very short shelf life. For the richest flavor, only purchase as much coffee as you will drink in a week, keep it sealed in its original package or a canister, and grind as you go. Side note: don''t keep your beans in the fridge or freezer. Doing this doesn''t prolong its life; in fact,  the coffee absorbs all those lovely refrigerator aromas (expired-potato-salad-pong-flavored Kona, anyone?). Keep the beans in a sealed container at room temperature and your coffee will stay its most flavorful and least corrupted.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Proportion.</span>\r\nThis depends on you and your taste buds, actually, but a general rule is one tablespoon per cup. A lot of places talk about proportions in grams, but not too many of us have an accurate kitchen scale laying around, so forget that. A typical French press holds 8 cups of liquid, therefore use 8 tbs. If I''m in an economical mood I sometimes do 7 tbs to 8 cups, but any less than that would leave your coffee tasting pretty watered down. You can increase it a bit if you really want an intense flavor, but I wouldn''t go more than 1 or 2 tablespoons over that or the flavor will be uncomfortably intense.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Temperature (Water again). </span>\r\nGet that water hot! An electric kettle works great if you have one, but use some method of boiling your water, even if it''s in a saucepan. The target temp is around 200 degrees Fahrenheit, so right after the water hits a boil let it settle down, and then pour it into the press making sure to saturate all the grounds. Caution: don''t burn the coffee! The flavor is extracted from the beans best around the 200 degree mark. If the water is any hotter, the coffee will taste over-extracted (bitter) and burnt.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Time it!</span>\r\nIt''s really important for the coffee and water to mix promiscuously allowing the oils to saturate and brew. 4 minutes allows this to be accomplished. If you are really striving for that cup of perfection, pour the water evenly over the grounds and fill the press a quarter full. Let the grounds then sit for a minute and “bloom”--then at the end of the minute, add the rest of the water and stir. If you don''t want to do that, just pour the water in all at once and give it a good stir.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Plunge it! </span>\r\nWhen four minutes are up, drive all the grounds to the bottom with the plunger. In most cases the plunger screens the grounds so that they don''t get into your cup. If you do get a couple, have no fear, they are not out to get you.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Drink it! </span>\r\nEnjoy this beautiful beverage! \r\n\r\nSo does this seem like a lot of work? Let''s think about it: depending on the elevation where you live, it takes somewhere around 2 to 4 minutes for water to boil. During that time I grab all my stuff: the press (I make sure it''s clean), grind the coffee, add it to the press, grab my cups, etc. and by the time everything is together the water is ready. I pour, and I set my timer to 4 minutes. You can do the math; it''s about six to eight minutes from start to finish. That''s just about the same time as a conventional brewer.\r\n\r\nBelow is a video you can watch to see how easy it really is. Enjoy :)\r\n\r\n<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/19587209?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933" width="525" height="295" frameborder="0"></iframe><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/19587209">French Press Style</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user5878817">Christan Fergus</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n', 'Make Good Coffee at Home: French Press Style', 'I know, we can all find our favorite coffee shop to get that essential coffee fix, and for a lot of people, it''s also tons better than what they prepare at home.

I do this because the crema is the soul of the espresso. Without it you are simply confronted with a dark and formless beverage that leaves you hovering over the face of some sort of liquid void. Crema contains the flavorful, complex, and oily soul of the espresso shot. It''s the lifeblood and excitement of coffee itself. \r\n\r\nThat said, when Bot1 discovered an entire coffee shop named after this beauty, it was a no-brainer, or in Bot1''s case, a no-CPUer that we check it out. Everything this shop does, it does well. The website, branding, interior design and ultimately, the coffee are nothing short of stellar. Bot1 is programmed to respond to excellence by demanding we go back again, and again, and again since it triggers an infinite system loop. Right off the bat, I''d recommend you do the same. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As we entered Crema (nestled in the Five Points area, or NoDo) I was struck by the overall simplicity and itty-bitty-ness of the place. The counter is no more than four paces from the front door and the menu is purposefully sparse—not only in its lack of fluff beverages but also in the fact that it is printed on the wall. It was immediately apparent the owner is a purist. For instance, this is not the shop for suburban frappu-whatever drinkers. Crema offers only three flavors: mocha, vanilla and caramel. It''s the equivalent to restoring peace to the world by neutralizing one coffee-assassinating flavor at a time. However, other than the occasional mocha, I don''t flavor my coffee, therefore my Americano was ordered. The lever was pulled, the shots were extracted, and the drink slid across the counter to me. The liquid rocked easily back and forth in the ceramic with the thick crema surface holding together tightly reflecting deep, red-brown and golden swirls. It glistened with the oily coffee bean residue (crema is the only time ''oil'' and ''residue'' are good things as descriptors), hinting at the flavor that was to come. Butter, caramel, crisp acidity and subtle bitterness filled my taste buds and for the first time in a very long time, I savored every single ounce of that Americano. (It''s at this point I should mention the espresso was a Novo roast. Sound familiar? Other roasters who make an appearance at Crema are Herkimer and Pablo''s- according to the website, that is.)\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> is what it is. Clearly underground, it is cold, utilitarian and industrial with a few reclaimed odds and ends. The tables and chairs have that certain retro flair, and I''m pretty sure they are original stuff, not overpriced re-makes. Hip below-ground art adorned the brick/plaster walls when I first visited, and the room was quite bright thanks to a fairly large red-pained window in the front. I had a bit of trouble finding an outlet for my laptop and finally found one behind a couch, but I noticed plenty of people on their Macs not bothered by this who apparently have risen above the need for a plug. Who needs an outlet, though? This is the sort of place you go to sip your velvety microfoam and discuss bands that don''t exist yet, not necessarily type up your doctoral thesis. There is a tiny bar that you can belly up to and watch the Baristas fashion their creations, and overall, considering the square footage, there is a good amount of seating for the size.\r\n\r\nFinally, a few points to note: First, you don''t go there if you are in a rush. It''s obvious the owner is more interested in the beverage quality than in the fact you forgot to set your alarm, spent too much time watching Kardashians reruns and are now running late for work. Every drink is made one-at-a time which maximizes quality but not speediness. In fact, if you are ordering a latte or cappuccino, each will include some sort of latte design, even if you are slapping a lid on it. Second, Crema''s muffins are insanely good and as a bonus they don''t have the paper wrapper around the bottom so you don''t have to peel it off. Let me tell you, this is reason enough to go there! Finally, they have a great selection of fine teas, but that review is up to TeaBot, not me, and TeaBot doesn''t even exist...yet.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> In conclusion: go there. No excuses, just go. You won''t regret it. \r\n[mappress mapid="10"]\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: center">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>\r\n<h2>Have you been to Crema?

I do this because the crema is the soul of the espresso. Without it you are simply confronted with a dark and formless beverage that leaves you hovering over the face of some sort of liquid void. Crema contains the flavorful, complex, and oily soul of the espresso shot. It''s the lifeblood and excitement of coffee itself. \r\n\r\nThat said, when Bot1 discovered an entire coffee shop named after this beauty, it was a no-brainer, or in Bot1''s case, a no-CPUer that we check it out. Everything this shop does, it does well. The website, branding, interior design and ultimately, the coffee are nothing short of stellar. Bot1 is programmed to respond to excellence by demanding we go back again, and again, and again since it triggers an infinite system loop. Right off the bat, I''d recommend you do the same. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> As we entered Crema (nestled in the Five Points area, or NoDo) I was struck by the overall simplicity and itty-bitty-ness of the place. The counter is no more than four paces from the front door and the menu is purposefully sparse—not only in its lack of fluff beverages but also in the fact that it is printed on the wall. It was immediately apparent the owner is a purist. For instance, this is not the shop for suburban frappu-whatever drinkers. Crema offers only three flavors: mocha, vanilla and caramel. It''s the equivalent to restoring peace to the world by neutralizing one coffee-assassinating flavor at a time. However, other than the occasional mocha, I don''t flavor my coffee, therefore my Americano was ordered. The lever was pulled, the shots were extracted, and the drink slid across the counter to me. The liquid rocked easily back and forth in the ceramic with the thick crema surface holding together tightly reflecting deep, red-brown and golden swirls. It glistened with the oily coffee bean residue (crema is the only time ''oil'' and ''residue'' are good things as descriptors), hinting at the flavor that was to come. Butter, caramel, crisp acidity and subtle bitterness filled my taste buds and for the first time in a very long time, I savored every single ounce of that Americano. (It''s at this point I should mention the espresso was a Novo roast. Sound familiar? Other roasters who make an appearance at Crema are Herkimer and Pablo''s- according to the website, that is.)\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> is what it is. Clearly underground, it is cold, utilitarian and industrial with a few reclaimed odds and ends. The tables and chairs have that certain retro flair, and I''m pretty sure they are original stuff, not overpriced re-makes. Hip below-ground art adorned the brick/plaster walls when I first visited, and the room was quite bright thanks to a fairly large red-pained window in the front. I had a bit of trouble finding an outlet for my laptop and finally found one behind a couch, but I noticed plenty of people on their Macs not bothered by this who apparently have risen above the need for a plug. Who needs an outlet, though? This is the sort of place you go to sip your velvety microfoam and discuss bands that don''t exist yet, not necessarily type up your doctoral thesis. There is a tiny bar that you can belly up to and watch the Baristas fashion their creations, and overall, considering the square footage, there is a good amount of seating for the size.\r\n\r\nFinally, a few points to note: First, you don''t go there if you are in a rush. It''s obvious the owner is more interested in the beverage quality than in the fact you forgot to set your alarm, spent too much time watching Kardashians reruns and are now running late for work. Every drink is made one-at-a time which maximizes quality but not speediness. In fact, if you are ordering a latte or cappuccino, each will include some sort of latte design, even if you are slapping a lid on it. Second, Crema''s muffins are insanely good and as a bonus they don''t have the paper wrapper around the bottom so you don''t have to peel it off. Let me tell you, this is reason enough to go there! Finally, they have a great selection of fine teas, but that review is up to TeaBot, not me, and TeaBot doesn''t even exist...yet.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> In conclusion: go there. No excuses, just go. You won''t regret it. \r\n[mappress mapid="10"]\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: center">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>\r\n<h2>Have you been to Crema?

I dragged Bot1 into Trident’s bookstore, leading him through the cozy nooks and tall shelves crammed with leather-bound covers and musty paperbacks, but he still doesn’t “get me.” Fortunately, Trident hosts an adjoining café that nearly always draws customers in with a delightful aroma of coffee, chai spice, and peppermint (those who are familiar with the general Eau de Boulder—a tantalizing mix of hung-over co-eds, stale doobies, and unwashed hippies—will appreciate this triumph). \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> Bot1 mumbled something about “intervention,” as he dragged me away from the brink of purchasing a fourth copy of Paradise Lost to the café counter. Though I’ve spent many an afternoon enjoying Trident’s artsy/cozy atmosphere, this was the first time I ordered coffee. Until today, I’d been systematically working my way through their wall of loose-leaf tea options (which they serve with a mug and a tiny personal tea pot), but I sensed Bot1 evaluating our friendship after my book-ogling, so I decided to follow his lead and order an Americano ($2.20). The barista was friendly, without forcing an artificial chattiness, and served my beautiful drink in a beer glass (the other option was a darling thimble-cup that would have left even Barbie with a severe case of caffeine deprivation). The glass showcased a beautiful crema; I hadn’t seen an Americano this sexy since I made them myself. I added a few drops of milk, but I needn’t even have done that. Trident’s espresso is smooth and well-balanced, while still maintaining a hearty richness, though some might prefer a “boulder” taste (hahaha—get it? “Boulder?” No? Oh, fine). \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span> We carried our drinks past rows of local photography displays (and a toasty woodstove) to the back of the café, where we fortunately found an empty booth. Though usually busy, Trident doesn’t seem to draw the typical student/tourist set. Instead, its location at the west end of Pearl St., and the fact that it has been around for over 20 years, attracts the local community—professors, grad students, environmentalists, business-owners, etc. The back patio sports a sand-box, so beware children. And pigeons. Inside, the storefront windows, exposed brick walls, and high ceiling create a comfortably bright atmosphere, although it can be slightly dark at night. Also, I fear our booth’s last occupant was a tamed wildebeest, judging from the gaping bum-crater in the seat cushion. Even perching on the crater’s ample rim, I needed a phone book to reach the table properly, which was bolted to the wall so that I also had to reach forward to scribble my notes. I recommend a regular table. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> Overall, Trident has perfected the balance between artistically hip and comfortably welcoming—like your impossibly cool, non-elitist friend who loves you despite your nerdy tendencies and bad puns. <span class="end-icon-bot6">END</span>\r\n[mappress mapid="12"]\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: center">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>\r\n<h2>Have you been to Trident Cafe?

This is especially the case for the majority of brewed coffee drinkers out there. But I''m here to tell you, you too can have amazing coffee at home! It''s not really that hard, it''s also not really that time consuming, you just need the right tools and the right ingredients. If you are completely okay with coffee that comes in a plastic tub or what you can grab out of the machine at 7-11, this post probably won''t mean much to you. But, if you are one of those who want that quality cup but don''t want to spend the $2 every day, or the host who wants to impress their guests with killer coffee and desert,  this just might help you out. The rest of this post assumes you are striving for excellence every time you make coffee in your casa and I will treat you accordingly. \r\n\r\n1.The Tools\r\nLike every project, you have to have the right tools to get the job done well. For this post, we''ll be making coffee via French press. So, you''ll need a-you guessed it-french press, a way to boil water, a timer and of course, coffee.\r\n2.Water is Key!\r\nFirst off, Your coffee is only as good as your water! The number one trick to good coffee is not the coffee but the water! Think about it: coffee is 98% H2O, so if your water tastes bad, chances are your coffee will as well even if you are using $50/lb coffee. You don''t have to have an expensive reverse osmosis system to achieve good water; a simple water filtering pitcher or even bottled drinking water will do the trick.\r\n3.The Coffee\r\nOkay, so for the good coffee beans, I recommend you pop down to your local coffee shop and purchase a half or full pound of beans. Don''t know what to get? Just ask, they are usually more than willing to chat and help you pick a roast. Shops often sell what they serve, so if there is a particular brew you really enjoy, grab a pound of that. It is also possible to find good beans in the grocery store but it''s a little harder and you don''t really know if it''s good or not until you try it. Here''s a tip: in my experience, anything with “gourmet” on the label is a complete flop and I would stay away from it like the plague. The same goes when I visit a restaurant or cafe and they describe their coffee as “gourmet”. This is a generic descriptor and most self-respecting roasters and coffee shops no longer use this term. \r\n4.Grind your coffee as you go\r\nIf you are not used to doing this, it may seem like quite a burden each time you make coffee, but here''s why you want to grind as you go: Once coffee has been roasted, oxygen becomes its mortal enemy and immediately the flavors in the oils begin to evaporate and the bean begins to turn sour. This is why coffee beans arrive in air-tight packages protected from all that nasty oxygen. Furthermore, when you grind the coffee, you compromise the ''housing'' for all this flavor and add more surface area for the beans to spoil giving the ground coffee a very, very short shelf life. So, only purchase as much coffee as you will drink in a week, keep it sealed in its original package or a canister, and grind as you go. Side note: don''t keep your beans in the fridge or freezer. Doing this doesn''t prolong its life, in fact, you make the coffee worse because it will absorb all those lovely aromas that are floating around in there (salmon flavored Kona, anyone?). Keep the beans at room temperature and you will be good.\r\n5.Proportion. \r\nThis is going to depend on you and your taste buds, actually. A general rule is one tablespoon per cup. A lot of places talk about proportions in grams and use quite a bit more than what I''m telling you to, but not too many of us have an accurate kitchen scale laying around, so forget that. A typical french press holds 8 cups of liquid, therefore use 8 tbs. If I''m in an economical mood I sometimes do 7 tbs to the 8 cups, but any less than that would leave your coffee tasting pretty watered down. You can up it a bit if you really want an intense flavor, but I wouldn''t go more than 1 or 2 tablespoons over that. \r\n6.Temperature (Water again) \r\nGet that water hot! An electric kettle works great if you have one, but use some method of boiling your water even if it''s in a saucepan. The target temp is around 200 degrees Fahrenheit, so right after the water hits a boil let it settle down and then pour into the press making sure to saturate all the grounds. Don''t burn the coffee! \r\n7.Time it!\r\nIt''s really important for the coffee and water to mix promiscuously allowing the oils to saturate and brew for the right amount of time. 4 minutes gets this done. If you are really striving for that cup of perfection, pour the water evenly over the grounds and fill the press a quarter full. Let the grounds then sit for a minute and “bloom”, then at the end of the minute add the rest of the water and stir. If you don''t want to do that, just pour the water in all at once and give it a good stir. \r\n8.Plunge it! \r\nWhen four minutes is up, drive all the grounds to the bottom with the plunger. In most cases the plunger works effectively to the point you don''t get any grounds in your cup. Even if you do get a couple have no fear, they are not out to get you. \r\n9.Drink it! \r\nEnjoy this beautiful beverage, you deserve it! Does this seem like a lot of work? Let''s think about it: depending on the elevation where you live, it takes somewhere around 2 to 4 minutes for water to boil. So what I do during that time is get the water heating up and then I grab all my stuff: the press (sometimes I clean it from the last time), grind the coffee, add it to the press, grab my cups, etc. and by the time everything is together (usually with time to spare) the water is ready, I pour, and I set my timer to 4 minutes. You can do the math, it''s about six to eight minutes from start to finish. That''s just about the same time as a conventional brewer! \r\n\r\nBelow is a video I made to also walk you through the process in case something I wrote didn''t quite make sense.

This is a generic descriptor and most self-respecting roasters and coffee shops no longer use this term. \r\n4.Grind your coffee as you go\r\nIf you are not used to doing this, it may seem like quite a burden each time you make coffee, but here''s why you want to grind as you go: Once coffee has been roasted, oxygen becomes its mortal enemy and immediately the flavors in the oils begin to evaporate and the bean begins to turn sour. This is why coffee beans arrive in air-tight packages protected from all that nasty oxygen. Furthermore, when you grind the coffee, you compromise the ''housing'' for all this flavor and add more surface area for the beans to spoil giving the ground coffee a very, very short shelf life. So, only purchase as much coffee as you will drink in a week, keep it sealed in its original package or a canister, and grind as you go. Side note: don''t keep your beans in the fridge or freezer. Doing this doesn''t prolong its life, in fact, you make the coffee worse because it will absorb all those lovely aromas that are floating around in there (salmon flavored Kona, anyone?). Keep the beans at room temperature and you will be good.\r\n5.Proportion. \r\nThis is going to depend on you and your taste buds, actually. A general rule is one tablespoon per cup. A lot of places talk about proportions in grams and use quite a bit more than what I''m telling you to, but not too many of us have an accurate kitchen scale laying around, so forget that. A typical french press holds 8 cups of liquid, therefore use 8 tbs. If I''m in an economical mood I sometimes do 7 tbs to the 8 cups, but any less than that would leave your coffee tasting pretty watered down. You can up it a bit if you really want an intense flavor, but I wouldn''t go more than 1 or 2 tablespoons over that. \r\n6.Temperature (Water again) \r\nGet that water hot! An electric kettle works great if you have one, but use some method of boiling your water even if it''s in a saucepan. The target temp is around 200 degrees Fahrenheit, so right after the water hits a boil let it settle down and then pour into the press making sure to saturate all the grounds. Don''t burn the coffee! \r\n7.Time it!\r\nIt''s really important for the coffee and water to mix promiscuously allowing the oils to saturate and brew for the right amount of time. 4 minutes gets this done. If you are really striving for that cup of perfection, pour the water evenly over the grounds and fill the press a quarter full. Let the grounds then sit for a minute and “bloom”, then at the end of the minute add the rest of the water and stir. If you don''t want to do that, just pour the water in all at once and give it a good stir. \r\n8.Plunge it! \r\nWhen four minutes is up, drive all the grounds to the bottom with the plunger. In most cases the plunger works effectively to the point you don''t get any grounds in your cup. Even if you do get a couple have no fear, they are not out to get you. \r\n9.Drink it! \r\nEnjoy this beautiful beverage, you deserve it! Does this seem like a lot of work? Let''s think about it: depending on the elevation where you live, it takes somewhere around 2 to 4 minutes for water to boil. So what I do during that time is get the water heating up and then I grab all my stuff: the press (sometimes I clean it from the last time), grind the coffee, add it to the press, grab my cups, etc. and by the time everything is together (usually with time to spare) the water is ready, I pour, and I set my timer to 4 minutes. You can do the math, it''s about six to eight minutes from start to finish. That''s just about the same time as a conventional brewer! \r\n\r\nBelow is a video I made to also walk you through the process in case something I wrote didn''t quite make sense.

This is especially the case for the majority of brewed coffee drinkers out there. But I''m here to tell you, you too can have amazing coffee at home! It''s not really that hard, it''s also not really that time consuming, you just need the right tools and the right ingredients. If you are completely okay with coffee that comes in a plastic tub or what you can grab out of the machine at 7-11, this post probably won''t mean much to you.

This is especially the case for the majority of brewed coffee drinkers out there. But I''m here to tell you, you too can have amazing coffee at home! It''s not really that hard, it''s also not really that time consuming, you just need the right tools and the right ingredients. If you are completely okay with coffee that comes in a plastic tub or what you can grab out of the machine at 7-11, this post probably won''t mean much to you. But, if you are one of those who want that quality cup but don''t want to spend the $2 every day, or the host who wants to impress their guests with killer coffee and desert,  this just might help you out. The rest of this post assumes you are striving for excellence every time you make coffee in your casa and I will treat you accordingly. \n\n<span class="first-words">The Tools...</span>\nLike every project, you have to have the right tools to get the job done well. For this post, we''ll be making coffee via French press. So, you''ll need a-you guessed it-french press, a way to boil water, a timer and of course, coffee.\n<span class="first-words">Water is Key!</span>\nFirst off, Your coffee is only as good as your water! The number one trick to good coffee is not the coffee but the water! Think about it: coffee is 98% H2O, so if your water tastes bad, chances are your coffee will as well even if you are using $50/lb coffee. You don''t have to have an expensive reverse osmosis system to achieve good water; a simple water filtering pitcher or even bottled drinking water will do the trick.\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span>\nOkay, so for the good coffee beans, I recommend you pop down to your local coffee shop and purchase a half or full pound of beans. Don''t know what to get? Just ask, they are usually more than willing to chat and help you pick a roast. Shops often sell what they serve, so if there is a particular brew you really enjoy, grab a pound of that. It is also possible to find good beans in the grocery store but it''s a little harder and you don''t really know if it''s good or not until you try it. Here''s a tip: in my experience, anything with “gourmet” on the label is a complete flop and I would stay away from it like the plague. The same goes when I visit a restaurant or cafe and they describe their coffee as “gourmet”. This is a generic descriptor and most self-respecting roasters and coffee shops no longer use this term. \n<span class="first-words">Grind Your Coffee As You Go or GYCAYG (looks like DNA or something)</span>\nIf you are not used to doing this, it may seem like quite a burden each time you make coffee, but here''s why you want to grind as you go: Once coffee has been roasted, oxygen becomes its mortal enemy and immediately the flavors in the oils begin to evaporate and the bean begins to turn sour. This is why coffee beans arrive in air-tight packages protected from all that nasty oxygen. Furthermore, when you grind the coffee, you compromise the ''housing'' for all this flavor and add more surface area for the beans to spoil giving the ground coffee a very, very short shelf life. So, only purchase as much coffee as you will drink in a week, keep it sealed in its original package or a canister, and grind as you go. Side note: don''t keep your beans in the fridge or freezer. Doing this doesn''t prolong its life, in fact, you make the coffee worse because it will absorb all those lovely aromas that are floating around in there (salmon flavored Kona, anyone?). Keep the beans at room temperature and you will be good.\n<span class="first-words">Proportion.</span>\nThis is going to depend on you and your taste buds, actually. A general rule is one tablespoon per cup. A lot of places talk about proportions in grams and use quite a bit more than what I''m telling you to, but not too many of us have an accurate kitchen scale laying around, so forget that. A typical french press holds 8 cups of liquid, therefore use 8 tbs. If I''m in an economical mood I sometimes do 7 tbs to the 8 cups, but any less than that would leave your coffee tasting pretty watered down. You can up it a bit if you really want an intense flavor, but I wouldn''t go more than 1 or 2 tablespoons over that. \n<span class="first-words">Temperature (Water again) </span>\nGet that water hot! An electric kettle works great if you have one, but use some method of boiling your water even if it''s in a saucepan. The target temp is around 200 degrees Fahrenheit, so right after the water hits a boil let it settle down and then pour into the press making sure to saturate all the grounds.

This is especially the case for the majority of brewed coffee drinkers out there. But I''m here to tell you, you too can have amazing coffee at home! It''s not really that hard, it''s also not really that time consuming, you just need the right tools and the right ingredients. If you are completely okay with coffee that comes in a plastic tub or what you can grab out of the machine at 7-11, this post probably won''t mean much to you. But, if you are one of those who want that quality cup but don''t want to spend the $2 every day, or the host who wants to impress their guests with killer coffee and desert,  this just might help you out. The rest of this post assumes you are striving for excellence every time you make coffee in your casa and I will treat you accordingly. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Tools...</span>\r\nLike every project, you have to have the right tools to get the job done well. For this post, we''ll be making coffee via French press. So, you''ll need a-you guessed it-french press, a way to boil water, a timer and of course, coffee.\r\n<span class="first-words">Water is Key!</span>\r\nFirst off, Your coffee is only as good as your water! The number one trick to good coffee is not the coffee but the water! Think about it: coffee is 98% H2O, so if your water tastes bad, chances are your coffee will as well even if you are using $50/lb coffee. You don''t have to have an expensive reverse osmosis system to achieve good water; a simple water filtering pitcher or even bottled drinking water will do the trick.\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span>\r\nOkay, so for the good coffee beans, I recommend you pop down to your local coffee shop and purchase a half or full pound of beans. Don''t know what to get? Just ask, they are usually more than willing to chat and help you pick a roast. Shops often sell what they serve, so if there is a particular brew you really enjoy, grab a pound of that. It is also possible to find good beans in the grocery store but it''s a little harder and you don''t really know if it''s good or not until you try it. Here''s a tip: in my experience, anything with “gourmet” on the label is a complete flop and I would stay away from it like the plague. The same goes when I visit a restaurant or cafe and they describe their coffee as “gourmet”. This is a generic descriptor and most self-respecting roasters and coffee shops no longer use this term. \r\n<span class="first-words">Grind Your Coffee As You Go or GYCAYG (looks like DNA or something)</span>\r\nIf you are not used to doing this, it may seem like quite a burden each time you make coffee, but here''s why you want to grind as you go: Once coffee has been roasted, oxygen becomes its mortal enemy and immediately the flavors in the oils begin to evaporate and the bean begins to turn sour. This is why coffee beans arrive in air-tight packages protected from all that nasty oxygen. Furthermore, when you grind the coffee, you compromise the ''housing'' for all this flavor and add more surface area for the beans to spoil giving the ground coffee a very, very short shelf life. So, only purchase as much coffee as you will drink in a week, keep it sealed in its original package or a canister, and grind as you go. Side note: don''t keep your beans in the fridge or freezer. Doing this doesn''t prolong its life, in fact, you make the coffee worse because it will absorb all those lovely aromas that are floating around in there (salmon flavored Kona, anyone?). Keep the beans at room temperature and you will be good.\r\n<span class="first-words">Proportion.</span>\r\nThis is going to depend on you and your taste buds, actually. A general rule is one tablespoon per cup. A lot of places talk about proportions in grams and use quite a bit more than what I''m telling you to, but not too many of us have an accurate kitchen scale laying around, so forget that. A typical french press holds 8 cups of liquid, therefore use 8 tbs. If I''m in an economical mood I sometimes do 7 tbs to the 8 cups, but any less than that would leave your coffee tasting pretty watered down. You can up it a bit if you really want an intense flavor, but I wouldn''t go more than 1 or 2 tablespoons over that. \r\n<span class="first-words">Temperature (Water again) </span>\r\nGet that water hot! An electric kettle works great if you have one, but use some method of boiling your water even if it''s in a saucepan. The target temp is around 200 degrees Fahrenheit, so right after the water hits a boil let it settle down and then pour into the press making sure to saturate all the grounds. Don''t burn the coffee! \r\n<span class="first-words">Time it!</span>\r\nIt''s really important for the coffee and water to mix promiscuously allowing the oils to saturate and brew for the right amount of time. 4 minutes gets this done. If you are really striving for that cup of perfection, pour the water evenly over the grounds and fill the press a quarter full. Let the grounds then sit for a minute and “bloom”, then at the end of the minute add the rest of the water and stir. If you don''t want to do that, just pour the water in all at once and give it a good stir. \r\n<span class="first-words">Plunge it! </span>\r\nWhen four minutes is up, drive all the grounds to the bottom with the plunger. In most cases the plunger works effectively to the point you don''t get any grounds in your cup. Even if you do get a couple have no fear, they are not out to get you. \r\n<span class="first-words">Drink it! </span>\r\nEnjoy this beautiful beverage, you deserve it! Does this seem like a lot of work? Let''s think about it: depending on the elevation where you live, it takes somewhere around 2 to 4 minutes for water to boil. So what I do during that time is get the water heating up and then I grab all my stuff: the press (sometimes I clean it from the last time), grind the coffee, add it to the press, grab my cups, etc. and by the time everything is together (usually with time to spare) the water is ready, I pour, and I set my timer to 4 minutes. You can do the math, it''s about six to eight minutes from start to finish. That''s just about the same time as a conventional brewer! \r\n\r\nBelow is a video I made to also walk you through the process in case something I wrote didn''t quite make sense.

For this post, we''ll be making coffee via French press, so, here''s what you''ll need:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>French press</li>\r\n	<li>grinder: blade or burr</li>\r\n	<li>kettle</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span class="first-words">The Ingredients...</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>whole bean coffee</li>\r\n	<li>filtered water</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Water is Key!</span>\r\nFirst off, your coffee is only as good as your water! The number one important element of good coffee is water! Think about it: coffee is 98% H2O, so if your water tastes bad, chances are your coffee will as well even if you are using $50/lb coffee. You don''t have to have an expensive reverse osmosis system to achieve good water; a simple water filtering pitcher, or even bottled drinking water will do the trick.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span>\r\nOkay, for (good) coffee beans, I recommend you pop down to your local coffee shop and purchase a half or full pound of beans. Don''t know what to get? Just ask, they are usually more than willing to chat and help you pick a roast. Shops often sell what they serve, so if there is a particular brew you really enjoy, grab a pound of that. It is also possible to find good beans in the grocery store, but it''s a little harder and you don''t really know if it''s good or not until you try it. Here''s a tip: in my experience, anything labeled with the generic descriptor “gourmet”  is a complete flop and I would avoid it like the plague. The same goes when I visit a restaurants and cafes. Most self-respecting roasters and coffee shops no longer use this term.\r\n<span class="first-words">Grind Your Coffee As You Go </span>\r\nThis may seem like quite a burden each time you make coffee, but here''s why you want to grind as you go: Once coffee has been roasted, oxygen becomes its mortal enemy and immediately the flavors in the oils begin to evaporate and the bean begins to sour. This is why coffee beans arrive in air-tight packages protected from all that nasty oxygen. Furthermore, when you grind the coffee, you compromise the flavor''s ''housing'' and add more surface area for the beans to spoil, giving the ground coffee a very, very short shelf life. For the richest flavor, only purchase as much coffee as you will drink in a week, keep it sealed in its original package or a canister, and grind as you go. Side note: don''t keep your beans in the fridge or freezer. Doing this doesn''t prolong its life; in fact,  the coffee absorbs all those lovely refrigerator aromas (salmon flavored Kona, anyone?). Keep the beans in a sealed container at room temperature and your coffee will stay its most flavorful.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Proportion.</span>\r\nThis depends on you and your taste buds, actually, but a general rule is one tablespoon per cup. A lot of places talk about proportions in grams, but not too many of us have an accurate kitchen scale laying around, so forget that. A typical French press holds 8 cups of liquid, therefore use 8 tbs. If I''m in an economical mood I sometimes do 7 tbs to 8 cups, but any less than that would leave your coffee tasting pretty watered down. You can increase it a bit if you really want an intense flavor, but I wouldn''t go more than 1 or 2 tablespoons over that.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Temperature (Water again). </span>\r\nGet that water hot! An electric kettle works great if you have one, but use some method of boiling your water, even if it''s in a saucepan. The target temp is around 200 degrees Fahrenheit, so right after the water hits a boil let it settle down, and then pour it into the press making sure to saturate all the grounds. Caution: don''t burn the coffee! The flavor is extracted from the beans best around the 200 degree mark. If the water is any hotter, the coffee will taste over-extracted (bitter) and burnt.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Time it!</span>\r\nIt''s really important for the coffee and water to mix promiscuously allowing the oils to saturate and brew. 4 minutes allows this to be accomplished. If you are really striving for that cup of perfection, pour the water evenly over the grounds and fill the press a quarter full. Let the grounds then sit for a minute and “bloom”--then at the end of the minute, add the rest of the water and stir. If you don''t want to do that, just pour the water in all at once and give it a good stir.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Plunge it! </span>\r\nWhen four minutes are up, drive all the grounds to the bottom with the plunger. In most cases the plunger screens grounds so that they don''t get  into your cup. If you do get a couple, have no fear, they are not out to get you.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Drink it! </span>\r\nEnjoy this beautiful beverage; you deserve it! Does this seem like a lot of work? Let''s think about it: depending on the elevation where you live, it takes somewhere around 2 to 4 minutes for water to boil. During that time I heat the water and then I grab all my stuff: the press (I make sure it''s clean), grind the coffee, add it to the press, grab my cups, etc. and by the time everything is together the water is ready. I pour, and I set my timer to 4 minutes. You can do the math; it''s about six to eight minutes from start to finish.

The number one important element of good coffee is water! Think about it: coffee is 98% H2O, so if your water tastes bad, chances are your coffee will as well even if you are using $50/lb coffee. You don''t have to have an expensive reverse osmosis system to achieve good water; a simple water filtering pitcher, or even bottled drinking water will do the trick.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span>\r\nOkay, for (good) coffee beans, I recommend you pop down to your local coffee shop and purchase a half or full pound of beans. Don''t know what to get? Just ask, they are usually more than willing to chat and help you pick a roast. Shops often sell what they serve, so if there is a particular brew you really enjoy, grab a pound of that. It is also possible to find good beans in the grocery store, but it''s a little harder and you don''t really know if it''s good or not until you try it. Here''s a tip: in my experience, anything labeled with the generic descriptor “gourmet”  is a complete flop and I would avoid it like the plague. The same goes when I visit a restaurants and cafes. Most self-respecting roasters and coffee shops no longer use this term.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Grind Your Coffee As You Go </span>\r\nThis may seem like quite a burden each time you make coffee, but here''s why you want to grind as you go: once coffee has been roasted, oxygen becomes its mortal enemy and immediately the flavors in the oils begin to evaporate and the bean begins to sour. This is why coffee beans arrive in air-tight packages protected from all that nasty oxygen. Furthermore, when you grind coffee, you compromise the flavor''s ''housing'' and add more surface area for the beans to spoil, giving the ground coffee a very, very short shelf life. For the richest flavor, only purchase as much coffee as you will drink in a week, keep it sealed in its original package or a canister, and grind as you go. Side note: don''t keep your beans in the fridge or freezer. Doing this doesn''t prolong its life; in fact,  the coffee absorbs all those lovely refrigerator aromas (expired-potato-salad-pong-flavored Kona, anyone?). Keep the beans in a sealed container at room temperature and your coffee will stay its most flavorful and least corrupted.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Proportion.</span>\r\nThis depends on you and your taste buds, actually, but a general rule is one tablespoon per cup. A lot of places talk about proportions in grams, but not too many of us have an accurate kitchen scale laying around, so forget that. A typical French press holds 8 cups of liquid, therefore use 8 tbs. If I''m in an economical mood I sometimes do 7 tbs to 8 cups, but any less than that would leave your coffee tasting pretty watered down. You can increase it a bit if you really want an intense flavor, but I wouldn''t go more than 1 or 2 tablespoons over that or the flavor will be uncomfortably intense.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Temperature (Water again). </span>\r\nGet that water hot! An electric kettle works great if you have one, but use some method of boiling your water, even if it''s in a saucepan. The target temp is around 200 degrees Fahrenheit, so right after the water hits a boil let it settle down, and then pour it into the press making sure to saturate all the grounds. Caution: don''t burn the coffee! The flavor is extracted from the beans best around the 200 degree mark. If the water is any hotter, the coffee will taste over-extracted (bitter) and burnt.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Time it!</span>\r\nIt''s really important for the coffee and water to mix promiscuously allowing the oils to saturate and brew. 4 minutes allows this to be accomplished. If you are really striving for that cup of perfection, pour the water evenly over the grounds and fill the press a quarter full. Let the grounds then sit for a minute and “bloom”--then at the end of the minute, add the rest of the water and stir. If you don''t want to do that, just pour the water in all at once and give it a good stir.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Plunge it! </span>\r\nWhen four minutes are up, drive all the grounds to the bottom with the plunger. In most cases the plunger screens the grounds so that they don''t get into your cup. If you do get a couple, have no fear, they are not out to get you.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Drink it! </span>\r\nEnjoy this beautiful beverage! \r\n\r\nSo does this seem like a lot of work? Let''s think about it: depending on the elevation where you live, it takes somewhere around 2 to 4 minutes for water to boil. During that time I heat the water and then I grab all my stuff: the press (I make sure it''s clean), grind the coffee, add it to the press, grab my cups, etc. and by the time everything is together the water is ready. I pour, and I set my timer to 4 minutes. You can do the math; it''s about six to eight minutes from start to finish.

The target temp is around 200 degrees Fahrenheit, so right after the water hits a boil let it settle down, and then pour it into the press making sure to saturate all the grounds. Caution: don''t burn the coffee! The flavor is extracted from the beans best around the 200 degree mark. If the water is any hotter, the coffee will taste over-extracted (bitter) and burnt.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Time it!</span>\r\nIt''s really important for the coffee and water to mix promiscuously allowing the oils to saturate and brew. 4 minutes allows this to be accomplished. If you are really striving for that cup of perfection, pour the water evenly over the grounds and fill the press a quarter full. Let the grounds then sit for a minute and “bloom”--then at the end of the minute, add the rest of the water and stir. If you don''t want to do that, just pour the water in all at once and give it a good stir.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Plunge it! </span>\r\nWhen four minutes are up, drive all the grounds to the bottom with the plunger. In most cases the plunger screens the grounds so that they don''t get into your cup. If you do get a couple, have no fear, they are not out to get you.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Drink it! </span>\r\nEnjoy this beautiful beverage! \r\n\r\nSo does this seem like a lot of work? Let''s think about it: depending on the elevation where you live, it takes somewhere around 2 to 4 minutes for water to boil. During that time I grab all my stuff: the press (I make sure it''s clean), grind the coffee, add it to the press, grab my cups, etc. and by the time everything is together the water is ready. I pour, and I set my timer to 4 minutes. You can do the math; it''s about six to eight minutes from start to finish. That''s just about the same time as a conventional brewer.\r\n\r\nBelow is a video you can watch to see how easy it really is.

This is especially the case for the majority of brewed coffee drinkers out there. Preparing excellent coffee at home is not really that hard; it''s also not really that time consuming. With the right tools and the right ingredients you can rival anything you find in a coffee shop. Look, If you are completely okay with coffee that comes from a plastic tub or out of the machine at 7-11, this post probably won''t mean much to you. If, however, you want that quality cup but don''t want to spend the $2 every day, or you want to impress your guests with killer coffee and dessert, this just might help you out. The rest of this post assumes you are striving for excellence every time you make coffee in your casa.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Tools...</span>\r\nFor every project, you have to have the right tools to get the job done well. For this post, we''ll be making coffee via French press, so, here''s what you''ll need:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>French press</li>\r\n	<li>grinder: blade or burr</li>\r\n	<li>kettle</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span class="first-words">The Ingredients...</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>whole bean coffee</li>\r\n	<li>filtered water</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Water is Key!</span>\r\nFirst off, your coffee is only as good as your water! The number one important element of good coffee is water! Think about it: coffee is 98% H2O, so if your water tastes bad, chances are your coffee will as well even if you are using $50/lb coffee. You don''t have to have an expensive reverse osmosis system to achieve good water; a simple water filtering pitcher, or even bottled drinking water will do the trick.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span>\r\nOkay, for (good) coffee beans, I recommend you pop down to your local coffee shop and purchase a half or full pound of beans. Don''t know what to get? Just ask, they are usually more than willing to chat and help you pick a roast. Shops often sell what they serve, so if there is a particular brew you really enjoy, grab a pound of that. It is also possible to find good beans in the grocery store, but it''s a little harder and you don''t really know if it''s good or not until you try it. Here''s a tip: in my experience, anything labeled with the generic descriptor “gourmet”  is a complete flop and I would avoid it like the plague. The same goes when I visit a restaurants and cafes. Most self-respecting roasters and coffee shops no longer use this term.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Grind Your Coffee As You Go </span>\r\nThis may seem like quite a burden each time you make coffee, but here''s why you want to grind as you go: once coffee has been roasted, oxygen becomes its mortal enemy and immediately the flavors in the oils begin to evaporate and the bean begins to sour. This is why coffee beans arrive in air-tight packages protected from all that nasty oxygen. Furthermore, when you grind coffee, you compromise the flavor''s ''housing'' and add more surface area for the beans to spoil, giving the ground coffee a very, very short shelf life. For the richest flavor, only purchase as much coffee as you will drink in a week, keep it sealed in its original package or a canister, and grind as you go. Side note: don''t keep your beans in the fridge or freezer. Doing this doesn''t prolong its life; in fact,  the coffee absorbs all those lovely refrigerator aromas (expired-potato-salad-pong-flavored Kona, anyone?). Keep the beans in a sealed container at room temperature and your coffee will stay its most flavorful and least corrupted.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Proportion.</span>\r\nThis depends on you and your taste buds, actually, but a general rule is one tablespoon per cup. A lot of places talk about proportions in grams, but not too many of us have an accurate kitchen scale laying around, so forget that. A typical French press holds 8 cups of liquid, therefore use 8 tbs. If I''m in an economical mood I sometimes do 7 tbs to 8 cups, but any less than that would leave your coffee tasting pretty watered down. You can increase it a bit if you really want an intense flavor, but I wouldn''t go more than 1 or 2 tablespoons over that or the flavor will be uncomfortably intense.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Temperature (Water again). </span>\r\nGet that water hot! An electric kettle works great if you have one, but use some method of boiling your water, even if it''s in a saucepan. The target temp is around 200 degrees Fahrenheit, so right after the water hits a boil let it settle down, and then pour it into the press making sure to saturate all the grounds. Caution: don''t burn the coffee! The flavor is extracted from the beans best around the 200 degree mark. If the water is any hotter, the coffee will taste over-extracted (bitter) and burnt.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">Time it!</span>\r\nIt''s really important for the coffee and water to mix promiscuously allowing the oils to saturate and brew. 4 minutes allows this to be accomplished.

Bot1 was also excited to visit since there were computers he could use instead of relying on his 28k on-board modem to download 25 minute drum solos.

The espresso was presented in a demitasse and I couldn''t wait to have my first sip. Once again, I stumbled on a place serving Novo coffee and was eager to see how it emerged from the machine. The first sip flashed with a bright acidity that yielded a complex cluster of flavors reminding me a bit of peanut butter—I was happy. It wasn''t the best espresso I''ve had but as the foundation to the rest of the beverages it was quality nonetheless. The mocha was fairly good as well (I sneaked a sip while Bot1 configured his IP address) although it was a bit sweet.

There is an abundance of places to sit, relax, work, and plug in. This is no internet cafe of the old days when shifty old guys hovered over bulky computers that were crammed against the walls of dingy, fluorescent-lit rooms sipping over-extracted, stale coffee. Instead you have flat panels, windows (so you''re not completely cut off from the world), shifty lawyers instead of shifty old guys, and superb coffee. Okay, I concede a bit of redefining. Fluid coffee has filled every nook with something for the customer: books, magazines, art, computers, and a [new] room full of tables that you can reserve for yourself or your team.

So, we headed for the shop and arrived barely out of the shadows of downtown''s skyscrapers in an uncomfortably sterile neighborhood of condos and street shops.\r\n\r\nMy first impression of the place was positive and not at all what I expected after checking the shop''s website (which doesn''t do the place any justice). It was packed with city peeps when we arrived and I wound my way through tables and urbanites to the counter where I was welcomed by a large overhead menu and a not so welcoming, too-cool-for-school barista. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee. </span>I ordered a double espresso ($1.80) and Bot1 went for the mocha (medium:$3.50). The espresso was presented in a demitasse and I couldn''t wait to have my first sip. Once again, I stumbled on a place serving Novo coffee and was eager to see how it emerged from the machine. The first sip flashed with a bright acidity that yielded a complex cluster of flavors reminding me a bit of peanut butter—I was happy. It wasn''t the best espresso I''ve had but as the foundation to the rest of the beverages it was quality nonetheless. The mocha was fairly good as well (I sneaked a sip while Bot1 configured his IP address) although it was a bit sweet. It''s also worth noting that this truly is a good place for the coffee aficionado since I saw numerous french presses and am pretty sure some pourover coffee magic. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere. </span>What really makes Fluid Coffee tick is what I mentioned in the beginning of this post: coffee shop ''redefinement-ation-ing''. There is an abundance of places to sit, relax, work, and plug in. This is no internet cafe of the old days when shifty old guys hovered over bulky computers that were crammed against the walls of dingy, fluorescent-lit rooms sipping over-extracted, stale coffee. Instead you have flat panels, windows (so you''re not completely cut off from the world), shifty lawyers instead of shifty old guys, and superb coffee. Okay, I concede a bit of redefining. Fluid coffee has filled every nook with something for the customer: books, magazines, art, computers, and a [new] room full of tables that you can reserve for yourself or your team. You also don''t have to be without those office amenities if you are working remotely. For a fee, you are able to print and copy your top secret documents or the next great American novel. There is even a large column right next to the counter plastered with adverts and business cards so you can get ye-self out there and get discovered. Finally, I found the atmosphere fairly inspirational: multicolored walls, comfortable seating, clutter, conversational murmur, and a diversity of patrons did well to get the juices flowing.

I dragged Bot1 into Trident’s bookstore, leading him through the cozy nooks and tall shelves crammed with leather-bound covers and musty paperbacks, but he still doesn’t “get me.” Fortunately, Trident hosts an adjoining café that nearly always draws customers in with a delightful aroma of coffee, chai spice, and peppermint (those who are familiar with the general Eau de Boulder—a tantalizing mix of hung-over co-eds, stale doobies, and unwashed hippies—will appreciate this triumph). \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee.</span> Bot1 mumbled something about “intervention,” as he dragged me away from the brink of purchasing a fourth copy of Paradise Lost to the café counter. Though I’ve spent many an afternoon enjoying Trident’s artsy/cozy atmosphere, this was the first time I ordered coffee. Until today, I’d been systematically working my way through their wall of loose-leaf tea options (which they serve with a mug and a tiny personal tea pot), but I sensed Bot1 evaluating our friendship after my book-ogling, so I decided to follow his lead and order an Americano ($2.20). The barista was friendly, without forcing an artificial chattiness, and served my beautiful drink in a beer glass (the other option was a darling thimble-cup that would have left even Barbie with a severe case of caffeine deprivation). The glass showcased a beautiful crema; I hadn’t seen an Americano this sexy since I made them myself. I added a few drops of milk, but I needn’t even have done that. Trident’s espresso is smooth and well-balanced, while still maintaining a hearty richness, though some might prefer a “boulder” taste (hahaha—get it? “Boulder?” No? Oh, fine). \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere.</span> We carried our drinks past rows of local photography displays (and a toasty woodstove) to the back of the café, where we fortunately found an empty booth. Though usually busy, Trident doesn’t seem to draw the typical student/tourist set. Instead, its location at the west end of Pearl St., and the fact that it has been around for over 20 years, attracts the local community—professors, grad students, environmentalists, business-owners, etc. The back patio sports a sand-box, so beware children. And pigeons. Inside, the storefront windows, exposed brick walls, and high ceiling create a comfortably bright atmosphere, although it can be slightly dark at night. Also, I fear our booth’s last occupant was a tamed wildebeest, judging from the gaping bum-crater in the seat cushion. Even perching on the crater’s ample rim, I needed a phone book to reach the table properly, which was bolted to the wall so that I also had to reach forward to scribble my notes. I recommend a regular table. \r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End.</span> Overall, Trident has perfected the balance between artistically hip and comfortably welcoming—like your impossibly cool, non-elitist friend who loves you despite your nerdy tendencies and bad puns. <span class="end-icon-bot6">END</span>\r\n[mappress mapid="12"]\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: center">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>\r\n<h2>What do you think?</h2>\r\n', 'Trident Booksellers and Cafe ', '...Trident hosts an adjoining café that nearly always draws customers in with a delightful aroma of coffee, chai spice, and peppermint (those who are familiar with the general Eau de Boulder—a tantalizing mix of hung-over co-eds, stale doobies, and unwashed hippies—will appreciate this triumph).

I tried to disagree by making the point French algorithms should just stay where they are, but after warning me he''d actually move to France if I didn''t let him, I traipsed him down to Cafe de Paris in Old Town(e) Louisville, Colorado to get it out of his system. \r\n\r\nAs one might expect, I figured this place was just another “in name only” joint that really had nothing to do with Paris at all (not that I''m an authority on the city). I was right, well, almost. When we walked in we were met with the croonings of a geeky jazz quartet—and for a brief moment it did indeed feel like a Paris cafe in the fifties. Or it at least felt like I''ve seen them portrayed in the movies. This was a nice surprise, and Bot1 approved so we decided to stay.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee</span> I edged around the double bass and did my best to remember my high school french. When I realized I couldn''t remember any of it, I ordered my coffee (in English) and took a corner table nestled under a bohemian lamp and beside a large picture window overlooking the bustling street. Once again, we''d stumbled on yet another shop serving Novo roasted coffee, which indicated off-the-bat that the desire for quality was present. And indeed, upon my first sip, that was the case. Full dimension, balanced flavor and lingering sweetness characterized the nectar that emerged from the Rancilio manual espresso machine. \r\n\r\n<a href="http://coffeebot.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cafedeparis_02.jpg"><img src="http://coffeebot.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cafedeparis_02-300x225.jpg" alt="cafe de paris" title="cafedeparis_02" width="300" height="225" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-634" /></a><span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span>  I was very comfortable sitting in this comfortably-cramp shop. The evening was warm and the sidewalk seating appealed to me, but Bot1 insisted we sit inside, and if you are a frequent reader of these posts, you know he gets his way. Six round tables fit where only four should go, but somehow it worked and I didn''t feel too claustrophobic. Perhaps it was the Bohemian flavor from the painted walls to the paintings on the walls, or the Victorian lamp shades, or all of these, but it was definitely the kind of place I could spend some time. In fact, you could get really comfortable for a long time since beer and wine are also served. I love coffee shops that do this—you''ve got all the bases covered. The shop definitely goes lengths to have that European vibe, down to elements you can''t necessarily control. Such as the hipster clientele who, as Bot1 and I sat and sipped our coffees and tapping our toes and metallic phalanges to the music, sketched and painted meaningful and earnest doodles at their tables. Had we stumbled across a sliver of the Paris art scene, one that stowed away on the Titanic, perhaps, only to be set adrift somehow surfacing upstream in Colorado? Okay, well that''s going a little too far, but needless to say it was a fun, and perhaps even inspiring atmosphere to be in. \r\n\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span> Don''t let me steer you wrong with my emphasis on coffee side of things, though. These guys are a full on “bistro” serving up a variety of tasty foods and desserts, even for those with slightly more high maintenance diets. I would however steer clear of their pastry items.

This is a place I had to visit. “Redefine(ing)” can be dangerous. Bot1 once tried to redefine rock. That''s how the world got prog-rock. Hopefully the coffee shop ''redefinement'' turns out a bit better. Bot1 was also excited to visit since there were computers he could use instead of relying on his 28k on-board modem to download 25 minute drum solos. So, we headed for the shop and arrived barely out of the shadows of downtown''s skyscrapers in an uncomfortably sterile neighborhood of condos and street shops.\n\nMy first impression of the place was positive and not at all what I expected after checking the shop''s website (which doesn''t do the place any justice). It was packed with city peeps when we arrived and I wound my way through tables and urbanites to the counter where I was welcomed by a large overhead menu and a not so welcoming, too-cool-for-school barista. \n\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee. </span>I ordered a double espresso ($1.80) and Bot1 went for the mocha (medium:$3.50). The espresso was presented in a demitasse and I couldn''t wait to have my first sip. Once again, I stumbled on a place serving Novo coffee and was eager to see how it emerged from the machine. The first sip flashed with a bright acidity that yielded a complex cluster of flavors reminding me a bit of peanut butter—I was happy. It wasn''t the best espresso I''ve had but as the foundation to the rest of the beverages it was quality nonetheless. The mocha was fairly good as well (I sneaked a sip while Bot1 configured his IP address) although it was a bit sweet. It''s also worth noting that this truly is a good place for the coffee aficionado since I saw numerous french presses and am pretty sure some pourover coffee magic. \n\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere. </span>What really makes Fluid Coffee tick is what I mentioned in the beginning of this post: coffee shop ''redefinement-ation-ing''. There is an abundance of places to sit, relax, work, and plug in. This is no internet cafe of the old days when shifty old guys hovered over bulky computers that were crammed against the walls of dingy, fluorescent-lit rooms sipping over-extracted, stale coffee. Instead you have flat panels, windows (so you''re not completely cut off from the world), shifty lawyers instead of shifty old guys, and superb coffee. Okay, I concede a bit of redefining. Fluid coffee has filled every nook with something for the customer: books, magazines, art, computers, and a [new] room full of tables that you can reserve for yourself or your team. You also don''t have to be without those office amenities if you are working remotely. For a fee, you are able to print and copy your top secret documents or the next great American novel. There is even a large column right next to the counter plastered with adverts and business cards so you can get ye-self out there and get discovered. Finally, I found the atmosphere fairly inspirational: multicolored walls, comfortable seating, clutter, conversational murmur, and a diversity of patrons did well to get the juices flowing. It''s the sort of place Bot1 and I can fit in with no brow-raising—it''s truly a neighborhood coffee shop. \n\n<span class="first-words">The End. </span>So, does it redefine the coffee shop experience? They certainly make it easy for the incognito professional to have place to work, serve outstanding coffee, and manage to do all this without being a creepy internet cafe. Fluid coffee has found a great mix of community, casual, and professional. At the same time, it''s still only a coffee shop: one that neither wowed or excited me, but one that I most definitely will recommend to others and visit again...and again. <span class="end-icon-bot2">END</span>\n[mappress mapid="13"]\n<p style="text-align: center">[ad#Google Adsense Post Ad]</p>\n', 'Buchanan’s Coffee Pub', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '610-revision-2', '', '', '2011-04-23 15:34:07', '2011-04-23 15:34:07', '', 610, 'http://coffeebot.co/coffee-shop-reviews/610-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Fortunately, Bot1 tends to swear in binary, or I’m certain we would have been kicked out before paying for our coffee (12 oz. Americano= $2.22). Fighting through the crowd, we claimed the only available table—on the patio, next to an enthusiastic dance major (aside: we soon learned that “super” has worked its way back into the English vernacular with a vengeance, at which point Bot1 nearly short-circuited). \r\n\r\nBuchanan’s patio flanks the front door, facing west toward the busy intersection of Pennsylvania and Broadway, and the University of Colorado. This arrangement creates a prime basking/people-watching location in the afternoon, but if you forget your sun block, you’ll be the proud owner of a highly awkward “half-face sunburn.” There’s a lot to see, as “the hill” is home to many strange creatures, including (but not limited to) religious recruiters, social advocates, and various strains of hippie. In addition, an unfortunately gangly “sk8rboi” in lime green “jeggings” is forever imprinted on my mind—I wish I were kidding. Those who insist on conversing above the ruckus eventually resort to shouting and, consequently, must suffer the judgment of the other customers (I dedicate this paragraph to the table of passionate poli-sci majors who were laboring under the communal delusion that the opinions they were shouting at one another were, somehow, different. But I digress).\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Coffee</span> Buchanan’s either servers Silver Canyon coffee or they stole their cups. Regardless, the espresso is medium-light, with a slightly bitter aftertaste (even with a touch of cream in it). My Americano was neither amazing nor unique, but having tasted the brown sludge for sale in the UMC, it’s worth the trek across campus. In addition to coffee, Buchanan’s sells pastries, gluten-free snacks, bagels, and (curiously) fair-trade crafts and jewelry.\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The Atmosphere</span> Eventually, a horde of people vacated the café lobby and Bot1 and I moved inside. I’d have to call Buchanan’s atmosphere “manufactured urban.” Local artwork and framed music posters decorate the walls, interspersed with intentionally exposed brick. Dozens of outlets run along the counters on three walls, which means that students (and visitors from the Boulder International Hostel just down the street) will move in here for hours at a time (the on-line printer and free-wifi probably add to the appeal). It’s bright, and the bluegrass/folk music sets a nice tone, but so many tables cram together that customers are constantly in each other’s  conversations (this might be fine for some, but Bot1 jumped in uninvited with “Heidegger, Derrida, and a duck walk into a bar . . .”). \r\n\r\n\r\n<span class="first-words">The End</span>There is paid parking in the lot across the street, or at meters along the block (beware parking in the adjacent neighborhoods, or you might find yourself the proud owner of 2 parking tickets—in the same envelope, no less!).
